        <h2 class="title editable block">The Problem of Security</h2>
        <p class="para editable block" id="mayer_1.0-ch28_s01_s01_p01">Creditors want assurances that they will be repaid by the debtor. An oral promise to pay is no security at all, and—as it is oral—it is difficult to prove. A <span class="margin_term"><a class="glossterm">signature loan</a><span class="glossdef">A loan for which no collateral is pledged.</span></span> is merely a written promise by the debtor to repay, but the creditor stuck holding a promissory note with a signature loan only—while he may sue a defaulting debtor—will get nothing if the debtor is insolvent. Again, that’s no security at all. Real security for the creditor comes in two forms: by agreement with the debtor or by operation of law without an agreement.</p>
        <div class="section" id="mayer_1.0-ch28_s01_s01_s01">
            <h2 class="title editable block">By Agreement with the Debtor</h2>
            <p class="para editable block" id="mayer_1.0-ch28_s01_s01_s01_p01">Security obtained through agreement comes in three major types: (1) personal property security (the most common form of security); (2) suretyship—the willingness of a third party to pay if the primarily obligated party does not; and (3) mortgage of real estate.</p>
        </div>
        <div class="section" id="mayer_1.0-ch28_s01_s01_s02">
            <h2 class="title editable block">By Operation of Law</h2>
            <p class="para editable block" id="mayer_1.0-ch28_s01_s01_s02_p01">Security obtained through operation of law is known as a <span class="margin_term"><a class="glossterm">lien</a><span class="glossdef">An encumbrance upon property to secure payment.</span></span>. Derived from the French for “string” or “tie,” a <em class="emphasis">lien</em> is the legal hold that a creditor has over the property of another in order to secure payment or discharge an obligation.</p>
            <p class="para editable block" id="mayer_1.0-ch28_s01_s01_s02_p02">In this chapter, we take up security interests in personal property and suretyship. In the next chapter, we look at mortgages and nonconsensual liens.</p>

        <h2 class="title editable block">Basics of Secured Transactions</h2>
        <p class="para editable block" id="mayer_1.0-ch28_s01_s02_p01">The law of secured transactions consists of five principal components: (1) the nature of property that can be the subject of a security interest; (2) the methods of creating the security interest; (3) the perfection of the security interest against claims of others; (4) priorities among secured and unsecured creditors—that is, who will be entitled to the secured property if more than one person asserts a legal right to it; and (5) the rights of creditors when the debtor defaults. After considering the source of the law and some key terminology, we examine each of these components in turn.</p>
        <p class="para editable block" id="mayer_1.0-ch28_s01_s02_p02">Here is the simplest (and most common) scenario: Debtor borrows money or obtains credit from Creditor, signs a note and security agreement putting up collateral, and promises to pay the debt or, upon Debtor’s default, let Creditor (secured party) take possession of (repossess) the collateral and sell it. <a class="xref" href="#mayer_1.0-ch28_s01_s02_f01">Figure 33.1 "The Grasping Hand"</a> illustrates this scenario—the grasping <em class="emphasis">hand</em> is Creditor’s reach for the collateral, but the hand will not close around the collateral and take it (repossess) unless Debtor defaults.</p>

            <p class="para editable block" id="mayer_1.0-ch28_s01_s03_s01_p01">Article 9 of the Uniform Commercial Code (UCC) governs security interests in personal property.

            <h2 class="title editable block">Definitions</h2>
            <p class="para editable block" id="mayer_1.0-ch28_s01_s03_s02_p01">As always, it is necessary to review some definitions so that communication on the topic at hand is possible. The secured transaction always involves a debtor, a secured party, a security agreement, a security interest, and collateral.</p>
            <p class="para editable block" id="mayer_1.0-ch28_s01_s03_s02_p02">Article 9 applies to any transaction “that creates a security interest.” The UCC in Section 1-201(35) defines <span class="margin_term"><a class="glossterm">security interest</a><span class="glossdef">Right in personal property to secure payment or performance of an obligation.</span></span> as “an interest in personal property or fixtures which secures payment or performance of an obligation.”</p>
            <p class="para editable block" id="mayer_1.0-ch28_s01_s03_s02_p03"><span class="margin_term"><a class="glossterm">Security agreement</a><span class="glossdef">Agreement that grants a security interest.</span></span> is “an agreement that creates or provides for a security interest.” It is the contract that sets up the debtor’s duties and the creditor’s rights in event the debtor defaults.<span class="footnote" id="mayer_1.0-fn28_002">Uniform Commercial Code, Section 9-102(a)(73).</span></p>
            <p class="para editable block" id="mayer_1.0-ch28_s01_s03_s02_p04"><span class="margin_term"><a class="glossterm">Collateral</a><span class="glossdef">Property given as security for a debt.</span></span> “means the property subject to a security interest or agricultural lien.”<span class="footnote" id="mayer_1.0-fn28_003">Uniform Commercial Code, Section 9-102(12).</span></p>
            <p class="para editable block" id="mayer_1.0-ch28_s01_s03_s02_p05"><span class="margin_term"><a class="glossterm">Purchase-money security interest</a><span class="glossdef">The security interest held by the seller of collateral to secure payment of all or part of the price.</span></span> (PMSI) is the simplest form of security interest. Section 9-103(a) of the UCC defines “purchase-money collateral” as “goods or software that secures a purchase-money obligation with respect to that collateral.” A PMSI arises where the debtor gets credit to buy goods and the creditor takes a secured interest in those goods. Suppose you want to buy a big hardbound textbook on credit at your college bookstore. The manager refuses to extend you credit outright but says she will take back a PMSI. In other words, she will retain a security interest in the book itself, and if you don’t pay, you’ll have to return the book; it will be repossessed. Contrast this situation with a counteroffer you might make: because she tells you not to mark up the book (in the event that she has to repossess it if you default), you would rather give her some other collateral to hold—for example, your gold college signet ring. Her security interest in the ring is not a PMSI but a pledge; a PMSI must be an interest in the particular goods purchased. A PMSI would also be created if you borrowed money to buy the book and gave the lender a security interest in the book.</p>
            <p class="para editable block" id="mayer_1.0-ch28_s01_s03_s02_p06">Whether a transaction is a lease or a PMSI is an issue that frequently arises. The answer depends on the facts of each case. However, a security interest is created if (1) the lessee is obligated to continue payments for the term of the lease; (2) the lessee cannot terminate the obligation; and (3) one of several economic tests, which are listed in UCC Section 1-201 (37), is met. For example, one of the economic tests is that “the lessee has an option to become owner of the goods for no additional consideration or nominal additional consideration upon compliance with the lease agreement.”</p>
            <p class="para editable block" id="mayer_1.0-ch28_s01_s03_s02_p07">The issue of lease versus security interest gets litigated because of the requirements of Article 9 that a security interest be perfected in certain ways (as we will see). If the transaction turns out to be a security interest, a lessor who fails to meet these requirements runs the risk of losing his property to a third party. And consider this example. Ferrous Brothers Iron Works “leases” a $25,000 punch press to Millie’s Machine Shop. Under the terms of the lease, Millie’s must pay a yearly rental of $5,000 for five years, after which time Millie’s may take title to the machine outright for the payment of $1. During the period of the rental, title remains in Ferrous Brothers. Is this “lease” really a security interest? Since ownership comes at nominal charge when the entire lease is satisfied, the transaction would be construed as one creating a security interest. What difference does this make? Suppose Millie’s goes bankrupt in the third year of the lease, and the trustee in bankruptcy wishes to sell the punch press to satisfy debts of the machine shop. If it were a true lease, Ferrous Brothers would be entitled to reclaim the machine (unless the trustee assumed the lease). But if the lease is really intended as a device to create a security interest, then Ferrous Brothers can recover its collateral only if it has otherwise complied with the obligations of Article 9—for example, by recording its security interest, as we will see.</p>
            <p class="para editable block" id="mayer_1.0-ch28_s01_s03_s02_p08">Now we return to definitions.</p>
            <p class="para editable block" id="mayer_1.0-ch28_s01_s03_s02_p09"><span class="margin_term"><a class="glossterm">Debtor</a><span class="glossdef">One who owes money or a duty of performance to another.</span></span> is “a person (1) having an interest in the collateral other than a security interest or a lien; (2) a seller of accounts, chattel paper, payment intangibles, or promissory notes; or (3) a consignee.”<span class="footnote" id="mayer_1.0-fn28_004">Uniform Commercial Code, Section 9-102(a)(28).</span></p>
            <p class="para editable block" id="mayer_1.0-ch28_s01_s03_s02_p10"><span class="margin_term"><a class="glossterm">Obligor</a><span class="glossdef">One who owes an obligation.</span></span> is “a person that, with respect to an obligation secured by a security interest in or an agricultural lien on the collateral, (i) owes payment or other performance of the obligation, (ii) has provided property other than the collateral to secure payment or other performance of the obligation, or (iii) is otherwise accountable in whole or in part for payment or other performance of the obligation.”<span class="footnote" id="mayer_1.0-fn28_005">Uniform Commercial Code, Section 9-102 (59).</span> Here is example 1 from the Official Comment to UCC Section 9-102: “Behnfeldt borrows money and grants a security interest in her Miata to secure the debt. Behnfeldt is a debtor and an obligor.”</p>
            <p class="para editable block" id="mayer_1.0-ch28_s01_s03_s02_p11">Behnfeldt is a debtor because she has an interest in the car—she owns it. She is an obligor because she owes payment to the creditor. Usually the debtor is the obligor.</p>
            <p class="para editable block" id="mayer_1.0-ch28_s01_s03_s02_p12">A <em class="emphasis">secondary obligor</em> is “an obligor to the extent that: (A) [the] obligation is secondary; or (b) [the person] has a right of recourse with respect to an obligation secured by collateral against the debtor, another obligor, or property of either.”<span class="footnote" id="mayer_1.0-fn28_006">Uniform Commercial Code, Section 9-102(a)(71).</span> The secondary obligor is a guarantor (surety) of the debt, obligated to perform if the primary obligor defaults. Consider example 2 from the Official Comment to Section 9-102: “Behnfeldt borrows money and grants a security interest in her Miata to secure the debt. Bruno cosigns a negotiable note as maker. As before, Behnfeldt is the debtor and an obligor. As an accommodation party, Bruno is a secondary obligor. Bruno has this status even if the note states that her obligation is a primary obligation and that she waives all suretyship defenses.”</p>
            <p class="para editable block" id="mayer_1.0-ch28_s01_s03_s02_p13">Again, usually the debtor is the obligor, but consider example 3 from the same Official Comment: “Behnfeldt borrows money on an unsecured basis. Bruno cosigns the note and grants a security interest in her Honda to secure her [Behnfeldt’s] obligation. Inasmuch as Behnfeldt does not have a property interest in the Honda, Behnfeldt is not a debtor. Having granted the security interest, Bruno is the debtor. Because Behnfeldt is a principal obligor, she is not a secondary obligor. Whatever the outcome of enforcement of the security interest against the Honda or Bruno’s secondary obligation, Bruno will look to Behnfeldt for her losses. The enforcement will not affect Behnfeldt’s aggregate obligations.”</p>
            <p class="para editable block" id="mayer_1.0-ch28_s01_s03_s02_p14"><span class="margin_term"><a class="glossterm">Secured party</a><span class="glossdef">The creditor who has a security interest in a debtor’s collateral.</span></span> is “a person in whose favor a security interest is created or provided for under a security agreement,” and it includes people to whom accounts, chattel paper, payment intangibles, or promissory notes have been sold; consignors; and others under Section 9-102(a)(72).</p>

            <p class="para editable block" id="mayer_1.0-ch28_s01_s04_s03_p01">This oddly named category is the middle ground between goods—stuff you can touch—and intangible property. It’s called “indispensable” because although the right to the value—such as a warehouse receipt—is embodied in a written paper, the paper itself is indispensable for the transferee to access the value. For example, suppose Deborah Debtor borrows $3,000 from Carl Creditor, and Carl takes a security interest in four designer chairs Deborah owns that are being stored in a warehouse. If Deborah defaults, Carl has the right to possession of the warehouse receipt: he takes it to the warehouser and is entitled to take the chairs and sell them to satisfy the obligation. The warehouser will not let Carl have the chairs without the warehouse receipt—it’s indispensable paper. There are four kinds of indispensable paper.</p>

The chattel paper is not yet collateral; the automobile is. Now, though, Creditor Car Company buys a new hydraulic lift from Lift Co., and grants Lift Co. a security interest in Debtor’s chattel paper to secure Creditor Car’s debt to Lift Co. The chattel paper is now collateral. Chattel paper can be tangible (actual paper) or electronic.</p>

The floating lien creates an interest that floats on the river of present and future collateral and proceeds held by—most often—the business debtor. It is especially useful in loans to businesses that sell their collateralized inventory. Without the floating lien, the lender would find its collateral steadily depleted as the borrowing business sells its products to its customers. Pretty soon, there’d be no security at all. The floating lien includes the following:</p>

In some states, that is the office of the Secretary of State; in others, it is the Department of Licensing; or it might be a private party that maintains the state’s filing system.<span class="footnote" id="mayer_1.0-fn28_035">Uniform Commercial Code, Section 9-501(a)(2).</span> The filing should be made in the state where the debtor has his or her primary residence for individuals, and in the state where the debtor is organized if it is a registered organization.<span class="footnote" id="mayer_1.0-fn28_036">Uniform Commercial Code, Section 9-307(b).</span> The point is, creditors need to know where to look to see if the collateral offered up is already encumbered. In any event, filing the statement in more than one place can’t hurt. The filing office will provide instructions on how to file; these are available online, and electronic filing is usually available for at least some types of collateral.</p>

The most important category of exempt collateral is that covered by state certificate of title laws. For example, many states require automobile owners to obtain a certificate of title from the state motor vehicle office. Most of these states provide that it is not necessary to file a financing statement in order to perfect a security interest in an automobile. The reason is that the motor vehicle regulations require any security interests to be stated on the title, so that anyone attempting to buy a car in which a security interest had been created would be on notice when he took the actual title certificate.<span class="footnote" id="mayer_1.0-fn28_037">Uniform Commercial Code, Section 9-303.</span></p>

            <p class="para editable block" id="mayer_1.0-ch28_s01_s06_s03_p01">A secured party may perfect the security interest by possession where the collateral is negotiable documents, goods, instruments, money, tangible chattel paper, or certified securities.<span class="footnote" id="mayer_1.0-fn28_040">Uniform Commercial Code, Section 9-313.</span> This is a pledge of assets (mentioned in the example of the stamp collection). No security agreement is required for perfection by possession.</p>
            <p class="para editable block" id="mayer_1.0-ch28_s01_s06_s03_p02">A variation on the theme of pledge is <span class="margin_term"><a class="glossterm">field warehousing</a><span class="glossdef">Mortgage arrangement in which a lender secures its loan with a lien on items stored in a warehouse or at the debtor’s place of business, with access to the items controlled by the lender, who releases goods as they are paid for by the borrower.</span></span>. When the pawnbroker lends money, he takes possession of the goods—the watch, the ring, the camera. But when large manufacturing concerns wish to borrow against their inventory, taking physical possession is not necessarily so easy. The bank does not wish to have shipped to its Wall Street office several tons of copper mined in Colorado. Bank employees perhaps could go west to the mine and take physical control of the copper, but banks are unlikely to employ people and equipment necessary to build a warehouse on the spot. Thus this so-called field pledge is rare.</p>
            <p class="para editable block" id="mayer_1.0-ch28_s01_s06_s03_p03">More common is the field warehouse. The field warehouse can take one of two forms. An independent company can go to the site and put up a temporary structure—for example, a fence around the copper—thus establishing physical control of the collateral. Or the independent company can lease the warehouse facilities of the debtor and post signs indicating that the goods inside are within its sale custody. Either way, the goods are within the physical possession of the field warehouse service. The field warehouse then segregates the goods secured to the particular bank or finance company and issues a warehouse receipt to the lender for those goods. The lender is thus assured of a security interest in the collateral.</p>

If it’s a checking account, for example, the bank with which the deposit account is maintained has “control”: the bank gets a security interest automatically because, as Official Comment 3 to UCC Section 9-104 puts it, “all actual and potential creditors of the debtor are always on notice that the bank with which the debtor’s deposit account is maintained may assert a claim against the deposit account.” “Control” of electronic chattel paper of investment property, and of letter-of-credit rights is detailed in Sections 9-105, 9-106, and 9-107. Obtaining “control” means that the creditor has taken whatever steps are necessary, given the manner in which the items are held, to place itself in a position where it can have the items sold, without further action by the owner.<span class="footnote" id="mayer_1.0-fn28_042">Uniform Commercial Code, Section 8-106, Official Comment 1.</span></p>

            <p class="para editable block" id="mayer_1.0-ch28_s01_s06_s05_p01">The fifth mechanism of perfection is addressed in Section 9-309 of the UCC: there are several circumstances where a security interest is perfected upon mere attachment. The most important here is <span class="margin_term"><a class="glossterm">automatic perfection</a><span class="glossdef">Perfection by mere attachment.</span></span> of a purchase-money security interest given in consumer goods. If a seller of consumer goods takes a PMSI in the goods sold, then perfection of the security interest is automatic. But the seller may file a financial statement and faces a risk if he fails to file and the consumer debtor sells the goods. Under Section 9-320(b), a buyer of consumer goods takes free of a security interest, even though perfected, if he buys without knowledge of the interest, pays value, and uses the goods for his personal, family, or household purposes—unless the secured party had first filed a financing statement covering the goods.</p>

                <p class="para" id="mayer_1.0-ch28_s01_s06_s05_p02">A creditor may be secured—allowed to take the debtor’s property upon debtor’s default—by agreement between the parties or by operation of law. The law governing agreements for personal property security is Article 9 of the UCC. The creditor’s first step is to attach the security interest. This is usually accomplished when the debtor, in return for value (a loan or credit) extended from the creditor, puts up as collateral some valuable asset in which she has an interest and authenticates (signs) a security agreement (the contract) giving the creditor a security interest in collateral and allowing that the creditor may take it if the debtor defaults. The UCC lists various kinds of assets that can be collateralized, ranging from tangible property (goods), to assets only able to be manifested by paper (indispensable paper), to intangible assets (like patent rights). Sometimes no security agreement is necessary, mostly if the creditor takes possession of the collateral. After attachment, the prudent creditor will want to perfect the security interest to make sure no other creditors claim an interest in the collateral. Perfection is most often accomplished by filing a financing statement in the appropriate place to put the world on notice of the creditor’s interest. Perfection can also be achieved by a pledge (possession by the secured creditor) or by “control” of certain assets (having such control over them as to be able to sell them if the debtor defaults). Perfection is automatic temporarily for some items (certified securities, instruments, and negotiable documents) but also upon mere attachment to purchase-money security interests in consumer goods.</p>
