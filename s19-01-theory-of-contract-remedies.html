        <h2 class="title editable block">Purpose of Remedies</h2>
        <p class="para editable block" id="mayer_1.0-ch16_s01_s01_p01">The fundamental purpose of remedies in noncriminal cases is not to punish the breaching party but—if possible—to put the nonbreaching party in the position he or she would have been in had there been no breach. Or, as is said, the purpose is to make the nonbreaching party whole.</p>
        <p class="para editable block" id="mayer_1.0-ch16_s01_s01_p02">There are two general categories of remedies—legal and equitable. In the category of legal remedies are <span class="margin_term"><a class="glossterm">damages</a><span class="glossdef">Money paid by one party to another to satisfy a liability.</span></span>. Damages are money paid by one party to another; there are several types of damages. In the category of equitable remedies are these three: <span class="margin_term"><a class="glossterm">specific performance</a><span class="glossdef">An order directing a person to deliver the unique thing contracted for by the other party.</span></span>, which means a person is ordered to deliver a unique thing (land or a unique personal property, such as a painting or an antique car); <span class="margin_term"><a class="glossterm">injunction</a><span class="glossdef">A judicial order directing a person to stop doing that which he or she should not do.</span></span>, a judicial order directing a person to stop doing what he or she should not do (such as competing with a former employer in violation of a noncompete agreement); and <span class="margin_term"><a class="glossterm">restitution</a><span class="glossdef">Restoration; returning goods or money to put the nonbreaching party in the condition as if the contract had not been made.</span></span>, which means putting the parties back into the position they were in before the contract was made.</p>

        <h2 class="title editable block">Parties Have the Power—but Not the Right—to Breach</h2>
        <p class="para editable block" id="mayer_1.0-ch16_s01_s02_p01">In view of the importance given to the intention of the parties in forming and interpreting contracts, it may seem surprising that the remedy for every breach is not a judicial order that the obligor carry out his or her undertakings. But it is not. Of course, some duties cannot be performed after a breach, because time and circumstances will have altered their purpose and rendered many worthless. Still, there are numerous occasions on which it would be theoretically possible for courts to order the parties to carry out their contracts, yet the courts will not do it. In 1897, Justice Oliver Wendell Holmes Jr. declared in a famous line that “the duty to keep a contract at common law means a prediction that you must pay damages if you do not keep it.” By that, he meant simply that the common law looks more toward compensating the promisee for his or her loss than toward compelling the promisor to perform. Indeed, the law of remedies often provides the parties with an incentive to break the contract. In short, the promisor has a choice: perform or pay.</p>
        <p class="para editable block" id="mayer_1.0-ch16_s01_s02_p02">The logic of this position is clear in many typical cases. The computer manufacturer orders specially designed circuit boards, then discovers before the circuits are made that a competitor has built a better machine and destroyed his market. The manufacturer cancels the order. It would make little economic sense for the circuit board maker to fabricate the boards if they could not be used elsewhere. A damage remedy to compensate the maker for out-of-pocket loss or lost profits is sensible; a judicial decree forcing the computer manufacturer to pay for and take delivery of the boards would be wasteful.</p>
        <p class="para editable block" id="mayer_1.0-ch16_s01_s02_p03">In general and if possible, the fundamental purpose of contract remedies is to put the nonbreaching party in the position it would have been in had there been no breach.</p>

            <h3 class="title">Key Takeaway</h3>
            <p class="para" id="mayer_1.0-ch16_s01_s02_p04">Remedies are intended to make the nonbreaching party whole. The two categories of remedies for breach of contract are legal and equitable. In the legal category are damages; in the equitable category are specific performance, injunctions, and restitution. The law does not force a party to perform; he or she always has the power (though not the right) to breach, and may do so if it is economically more advantageous to breach and suffer the consequence than to perform. Remedies, though, are not (usually) intended to punish the breaching party.</p>

                <li>Remedies are not supposed to punish the breaching party, generally. In what circumstances might punishment be a remedy, and what is that called?</li>
