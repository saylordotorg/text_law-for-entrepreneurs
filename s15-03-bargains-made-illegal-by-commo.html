        <p class="para editable block" id="mayer_1.0-ch12_s03_s01_p01">Public policy is expressed by courts as well as legislatures. In determining whether to enforce a contract where there is no legislative dictate, courts must ordinarily balance the interests at stake. To strike the proper balance, courts must weigh the parties’ expectations, the forfeitures that would result from denial of enforcement, and the public interest favoring enforcement against these factors: the strength of the policy, whether denying enforcement will further the policy, the seriousness and deliberateness of the violation, and how direct the connection is between the misconduct and the contractual term to be enforced.<span class="footnote" id="mayer_1.0-fn12_006">Restatement (Second) of Contracts, Section 178.</span></p>

        <div class="section" id="mayer_1.0-ch12_s03_s02_s01">
            <h2 class="title editable block">Common-Law Restraint of Trade</h2>
            <p class="para editable block" id="mayer_1.0-ch12_s03_s02_s01_p01">One of the oldest public policies evolved by courts is the common-law prohibition against restraint of trade. From the early days of industrialism, the courts took a dim view of ostensible competitors who agreed among themselves to fix prices or not to sell in each other’s territories. Since 1890, with the enactment of the Sherman Act, the law of restraint of trade has been absorbed by federal and state antitrust statutes. But the common-law prohibition still exists. Though today it is concerned almost exclusively with promises not to compete in sales of businesses and employment contracts, it can arise in other settings. For example, George’s promise to Arthur never to sell the parcel of land that Arthur is selling to him is void because it unreasonably restrains trade in the land.</p>
            <p class="para editable block" id="mayer_1.0-ch12_s03_s02_s01_p02">The general rule is one of reason: not every restraint of trade is unlawful; only unreasonable ones are. As the Restatement puts it, “Every promise that relates to business dealings or to a professional or other gainful occupation operates as a restraint in the sense that it restricts the promisor’s future activity. Such a promise is not, however, unenforceable, unless the restraint that it imposes is unreasonably detrimental to the smooth operation of a freely competitive private economy.”<span class="footnote" id="mayer_1.0-fn12_007">Restatement (Second) of Contracts, Section 186(a).</span> An agreement that restrains trade will be construed as unreasonable unless it is ancillary to a legitimate business interest and is no greater than necessary to protect the legitimate interest. Restraint-of-trade cases usually arise in two settings: (1) the sale of a business and an attendant agreement not to compete with the purchasers and (2) an employee’s agreement not to compete with the employer should the employee leave for any reason.</p>
            <div class="section" id="mayer_1.0-ch12_s03_s02_s01_s01">
                <h2 class="title editable block">Sale of a Business</h2>
                <p class="para editable block" id="mayer_1.0-ch12_s03_s02_s01_s01_p01">A first common area where a restraint-of-trade issue may arise is with the sale of a business. Regina sells her lingerie store to Victoria and promises not to establish a competing store in town for one year. Since Victoria is purchasing Regina’s goodwill (the fact that customers are used to shopping at her store), as well as her building and inventory, there is clearly a property interest to be protected. And the geographical limitation (“in town”) is reasonable if that is where the store does business. But if Regina had agreed not to engage in any business in town, or to wait ten years before opening up a new store, or not to open up a new store anywhere within one hundred miles of town, she could avoid the noncompetition terms of the contract because the restraint in each case (nature, duration, and geographic area of restraint) would have been broader than necessary to protect Victoria’s interest. Whether the courts will uphold an agreement not to compete depends on all the circumstances of the particular case, as the Connecticut barber in <a class="xref" href="mayer_1.0-ch12_s05#mayer_1.0-ch12_s05_s03">Section 12.5.3 "Unconscionability"</a> discovered.</p>

                <h2 class="title editable block">Employment Noncompete Agreements</h2>
                <p class="para editable block" id="mayer_1.0-ch12_s03_s02_s01_s02_p01">A second common restraint-of-trade issue arises with regard to <span class="margin_term"><a class="glossterm">noncompete agreements</a><span class="glossdef">One party agrees not to pursue a similar profession or trade in competition against another party.</span></span> in employment contracts. As a condition of employment by the research division of a market research firm, Bruce, a product analyst, is required to sign an agreement in which he promises, for a period of one year after leaving the company, not to “engage, directly or indirectly, in any business competing with the company and located within fifty miles of the company’s main offices.” The principal reason recited in the agreement for this covenant not to compete is that by virtue of the employment, Bruce will come to learn a variety of internal secrets, including client lists, trade or business secrets, reports, confidential business discussions, ongoing research, publications, computer programs, and related papers. Is this agreement a lawful restraint of trade?</p>
                <p class="para editable block" id="mayer_1.0-ch12_s03_s02_s01_s02_p02">Here both the property interest of the employer and the extent of the restraint are issues. Certainly an employer has an important competitive interest in seeing that company information not walk out the door with former employees. Nevertheless, a promise by an employee not to compete with his or her former employer is scrutinized carefully by the courts, and an <span class="margin_term"><a class="glossterm">injunction</a><span class="glossdef">A judicial order directing a person to stop doing that which he or she should not do.</span></span> (an order directing a person to stop doing what he or she should not do) will be issued cautiously, partly because the prospective employee is usually confronted with a <span class="margin_term"><a class="glossterm">contract of adhesion</a><span class="glossdef">A contract presented to the offeree to take or leave without bargaining.</span></span> (take it or leave it) and is in a weak bargaining position compared to the employer, and partly because an injunction might cause the employee’s unemployment. Many courts are not enthusiastic about employment noncompete agreements. The California Business and Professions Code provides that “every contract by which anyone is restrained from engaging in a lawful profession, trade, or business of any kind is to that extent void.”<span class="footnote" id="mayer_1.0-fn12_008">California Business and Professions Code, Section 16600.</span> As a result of the statute, and to promote entrepreneurial robustness, California courts typically interpret the statute broadly and refuse to enforce noncompete agreements. Other states are less stingy, and employers have attempted to avoid the strictures of no-enforcement state rulings by providing that their employment contracts will be interpreted according to the law of a state where noncompetes are favorably viewed.</p>
                <p class="para editable block" id="mayer_1.0-ch12_s03_s02_s01_s02_p03">If a covenant not to compete is ruled unlawful, the courts can pursue one of three courses by way of remedy. A court can refuse to enforce the entire covenant, freeing the employee to compete thenceforth. The court could delete from the agreement only that part that is unreasonable and enforce the remainder (the “blue pencil” rule). In some states, the courts have moved away from this rule and have actually taken to rewriting the objectionable clause themselves. Since the parties intended that there be some form of restriction on competition, a reasonable modification would achieve a more just result.<span class="footnote" id="mayer_1.0-fn12_009"><em class="emphasis">Raimondo v.

            <h2 class="title editable block">Unconscionable Contracts</h2>
            <p class="para editable block" id="mayer_1.0-ch12_s03_s02_s02_p01">Courts may refuse to enforce <span class="margin_term"><a class="glossterm">unconscionable contracts</a><span class="glossdef">A contract so unfair as to be unenforceable.</span></span>, those that are very one-sided, unfair, the product of unequal bargaining power, or oppressive; a court may find the contract divisible and enforce only the parts that are not unconscionable.</p>
            <p class="para editable block" id="mayer_1.0-ch12_s03_s02_s02_p02">The common-law rule is reflected in Section 208 of the Restatement: “If a contract or term thereof is unconscionable at the time the contract is made a court may refuse to enforce the contract, or may enforce the remainder of the contract without the unconscionable term, or may so limit the application of any unconscionable term as to avoid any unconscionable result.”</p>
            <p class="para editable block" id="mayer_1.0-ch12_s03_s02_s02_p03">And the Uniform Commercial Code (UCC) (again, of course, a statute, not common law) provides a similar rule in Section 2-302(1): “If the court as a matter of law finds the contract or any clause of the contract to have been unconscionable at the time it was made the court may refuse to enforce the contract, or it may enforce the remainder of the contract without the unconscionable clause, or it may so limit the application of any unconscionable clause as to avoid any unconscionable result.”</p>
            <p class="para editable block" id="mayer_1.0-ch12_s03_s02_s02_p04"><em class="emphasis">Unconscionable</em> is not defined in the Restatement or the UCC, but cases have given gloss to the meaning, as in <a class="xref" href="mayer_1.0-ch12_s05#mayer_1.0-ch12_s05_s03">Section 12.5.3 "Unconscionability"</a>, <em class="emphasis">Williams v. Walker-Thomas Furniture Co.</em>, a well-known early interpretation of the section by the DC Court of Appeals.</p>
            <p class="para editable block" id="mayer_1.0-ch12_s03_s02_s02_p05">Unconscionability may arise procedurally or substantively. A term is procedurally unconscionable if it is imposed upon the “weaker” party because of fine or inconspicuous print, unexpected placement in the contract, lack of opportunity to read the term, lack of education or sophistication that precludes understanding, or lack of equality of bargaining power. Substantive unconscionability arises where the affected terms are oppressive and harsh, where the term deprives a party of any real remedy for breach. Most often—but not always—courts find unconscionable contracts in the context of consumer transactions rather than commercial transactions. In the latter case, the assumption is that the parties tend to be sophisticated businesspeople able to look out for their own contract interests.</p>

            <h2 class="title editable block">Exculpatory Clauses</h2>
            <p class="para editable block" id="mayer_1.0-ch12_s03_s02_s03_p01">The courts have long held that public policy disfavors attempts to contract out of tort liability. <span class="margin_term"><a class="glossterm">Exculpatory clauses</a><span class="glossdef">A term in a contract by which one party relieves itself in advance of liability.</span></span> that exempt one party from tort liability to the other for harm caused intentionally or recklessly are unenforceable without exception. A contract provision that exempts a party from tort liability for negligence is unenforceable under two general circumstances: (1) when it “exempts an employer from liability to an employee for injury in the course of his employment” or (2) when it exempts one charged with a duty of public service and who is receiving compensation from liability to one to whom the duty is owed.<span class="footnote" id="mayer_1.0-fn12_010">Restatement (Second) of Contracts, Section 195.</span> Contract terms with offensive exculpatory clauses may be considered somewhat akin to unconscionability.</p>
            <p class="para editable block" id="mayer_1.0-ch12_s03_s02_s03_p02">Put shortly, exculpatory clauses are OK if they are reasonable. Put not so shortly, exculpatory clauses will generally be held valid if (1) the agreement does not involve a business generally thought suitable for public regulation (a twenty-kilometer bicycle race, for example, is probably not one thought generally suitable for public regulation, whereas a bus line is); (2) the party seeking exculpation is not performing a business of great importance to the public or of practical necessity for some members of the public; (3) the party does not purport to be performing the service to just anybody who comes along (unlike the bus line); (4) the parties are dealing at arms’ length, able to bargain about the contract; (5) the person or property of the purchaser is not placed under control of the seller, subject to his or his agent’s carelessness; or (6) the clause is conspicuous and clear.<span class="footnote" id="mayer_1.0-fn12_011"><em class="emphasis">Henrioulle v.

            <h2 class="title editable block">Obstructing the Administration of Justice or Violating a Public Duty</h2>
            <p class="para editable block" id="mayer_1.0-ch12_s03_s02_s04_p01">It is well established under common law that contracts that would interfere with the administration of justice or that call upon a public official to violate a public duty are void and unenforceable. Examples of such contracts are numerous: to conceal or compound a crime, to pay for the testimony of a witness in court contingent on the court’s ruling, to suppress evidence by paying a witness to leave the state, or to destroy documents. Thus, in an unedifying case in Arkansas, a gambler sued a circuit court judge to recover $1,675 allegedly paid to the judge as protection money, and the Arkansas Supreme Court affirmed the dismissal of the suit, holding, “The law will not aid either party to the alleged illegal and void contract…‘but will leave them where it finds them, if they have been equally cognizant of the illegality.’”<span class="footnote" id="mayer_1.0-fn12_012"><em class="emphasis">Womack v. Maner</em>, 301 S.W.2d 438 (Ark. 1957).</span> Also in this category are bribes, agreements to obstruct or delay justice (jury tampering, abuse of the legal process), and the like.</p>

        <div class="section" id="mayer_1.0-ch12_s03_s02_s05">
            <h2 class="title editable block">Family Relations</h2>
            <p class="para editable block" id="mayer_1.0-ch12_s03_s02_s05_p01">Another broad area in which public policy intrudes on private contractual arrangements is that of undertakings between couples, either prior to or during marriage. Marriage is quintessentially a relationship defined by law, and individuals have limited ability to change its scope through legally enforceable contracts. Moreover, marriage is an institution that public policy favors, and agreements that unreasonably restrain marriage are void. Thus a father’s promise to pay his twenty-one-year-old daughter $100,000 if she refrains from marrying for ten years would be unenforceable. However, a promise in a <span class="margin_term"><a class="glossterm">postnuptial (after marriage) agreement</a><span class="glossdef">A contract made by spouses after marriage in which they agree on property division.</span></span> that if the husband predeceases the wife, he will provide his wife with a fixed income for as long as she remains unmarried is valid because the offer of support is related to the need. (Upon remarriage, the need would presumably be less pressing.) Property settlements before, during, or upon the breakup of a marriage are generally enforceable, since property is not considered to be an essential incident of marriage. But agreements in the form of property arrangements that tend to be detrimental to marriage are void—for example, a <span class="margin_term"><a class="glossterm">prenuptial (premarital) contract</a><span class="glossdef">A premartial contract by which spouses agree on property division.</span></span> in which the wife-to-be agrees on demand of the husband-to-be to leave the marriage and renounce any claims upon the husband-to-be at any time in the future in return for which he will pay her $100,000. Separation agreements are not considered detrimental to marriage as long as they are entered after or in contemplation of immediate separation; but a separation agreement must be “fair” under the circumstances, and judges may review them upon challenge. Similarly, child custody agreements are not left to the whim of the parents but must be consistent with the best interest of the child, and the courts retain the power to examine this question.</p>
            <p class="para editable block" id="mayer_1.0-ch12_s03_s02_s05_p02">The types of contracts or bargains that might be found illegal are innumerable, limited only by the ingenuity of those who seek to overreach.</p>
