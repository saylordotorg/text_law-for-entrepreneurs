        <p class="para editable block" id="mayer_1.0-ch43_s04_s01_p01">One of the four major classifications of corporations is the <span class="margin_term"><a class="glossterm">nonprofit corporation</a><span class="glossdef">A corporation in which no part of the income is distributable to its members, directors, or officers.</span></span> (also called not-for-profit corporation). It is defined in the American Bar Association’s Model Non-Profit Corporation Act as “a corporation no part of the income of <em class="emphasis">which</em> is distributable to its members, directors or officers.” Nonprofit corporations may be formed under this law for charitable, educational, civil, religious, social, and cultural purposes, among others.</p>

    <div class="section" id="mayer_1.0-ch43_s04_s02">
        <h2 class="title editable block">Public Corporations</h2>
        <p class="para editable block" id="mayer_1.0-ch43_s04_s02_p01">The true public corporation is a governmental entity. It is often called a <span class="margin_term"><a class="glossterm">municipal corporation</a><span class="glossdef">A governmental entity; also called a public corporation.</span></span>, to distinguish it from the publicly held corporation, which is sometimes also referred to as a “public” corporation, although it is in fact private (i.e., it is not governmental). Major cities and counties, and many towns, villages, and special governmental units, such as sewer, transportation, and public utility authorities, are incorporated. These corporations are not organized for profit, do not have shareholders, and operate under different statutes than do business corporations.</p>

    <div class="section" id="mayer_1.0-ch43_s04_s03">
        <h2 class="title editable block">Professional Corporations</h2>
        <p class="para editable block" id="mayer_1.0-ch43_s04_s03_p01">Until the 1960s, lawyers, doctors, accountants, and other professionals could not practice their professions in corporate form. This inability, based on a fear of professionals’ being subject to the direction of the corporate owners, was financially disadvantageous. Under the federal income tax laws then in effect, corporations could establish far better pension plans than could the self-employed. During the 1960s, the states began to let professionals incorporate, but the IRS balked, denying them many tax benefits. In 1969, the IRS finally conceded that it would tax a <span class="margin_term"><a class="glossterm">professional corporation</a><span class="glossdef">A corporation of lawyers, doctor, accountants, or other professionals who enjoy the same benefits in corporate form as do other corporations.</span></span> just as it would any other corporation, so that professionals could, from that time on, place a much higher proportion of tax-deductible income into a tax-deferred pension. That decision led to a burgeoning number of professional corporations.</p>

        <h2 class="title editable block">Business Corporations</h2>
        <div class="section" id="mayer_1.0-ch43_s04_s04_s01">
            <h2 class="title editable block">The Two Types</h2>
            <p class="para editable block" id="mayer_1.0-ch43_s04_s04_s01_p01">It is the <span class="margin_term"><a class="glossterm">business corporation</a><span class="glossdef">In contrast to public (municipal), professional, or nonprofit corporations, business corporations are of two types: publicly held and closely held, referring to how the stock is held within the corporation.</span></span> proper that we focus on in this unit. There are two broad types of business corporations: publicly held (or public) and closely held (or close or private) corporations. Again, both types are private in the sense that they are not governmental.</p>
            <p class="para editable block" id="mayer_1.0-ch43_s04_s04_s01_p02">The publicly held corporation is one in which stock is widely held or available for wide public distribution through such means as trading on a national or regional stock exchange. Its managers, if they are also owners of stock, usually constitute a small percentage of the total number of shareholders and hold a small amount of stock relative to the total shares outstanding. Few, if any, shareholders of public corporations know their fellow shareholders.</p>
            <p class="para editable block" id="mayer_1.0-ch43_s04_s04_s01_p03">By contrast, the shareholders of the closely held corporation are fewer in number. Shares in a closely held corporation could be held by one person, and usually by no more than thirty. Shareholders of the closely held corporation often share family ties or have some other association that permits each to know the others.</p>
            <p class="para editable block" id="mayer_1.0-ch43_s04_s04_s01_p04">Though most closely held corporations are small, no economic or legal reason prevents them from being large. Some are huge, having annual sales of several billion dollars each. Roughly 90 percent of US corporations are closely held.</p>
            <p class="para editable block" id="mayer_1.0-ch43_s04_s04_s01_p05">The giant publicly held companies with more than $1 billion in assets and sales, with initials such as IBM and GE, constitute an exclusive group. Publicly held corporations outside this elite class fall into two broad (nonlegal) categories: those that are quoted on stock exchanges and those whose stock <em class="emphasis">is</em> too widely dispersed to be called closely held but is not traded on exchanges.</p>

                <p class="para" id="mayer_1.0-ch43_s04_s04_s01_p06">There are four major classifications of corporations: (1) nonprofit, (2) municipal, (3) professional, and (4) business. Business corporations are divided into two types, publicly held and closely held corporations.</p>
