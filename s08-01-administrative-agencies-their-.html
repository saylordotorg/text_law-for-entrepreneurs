        <h2 class="title editable block">Why Have Administrative Agencies?</h2>
        <p class="para editable block" id="mayer_1.0-ch05_s01_s01_p01">The US Constitution mentions only three branches of government: legislative, executive, and judicial (Articles I, II, and III). There is no mention of agencies in the Constitution, even though federal agencies are sometimes referred to as “the fourth branch of government.” The Supreme Court has recognized the legitimacy of federal <span class="margin_term"><a class="glossterm">administrative agencies</a><span class="glossdef">Governmental units, either state or federal, that have specialized expertise and authority over some area of the economy.</span></span> to make rules that have the same binding effect as statutes by Congress.</p>
        <p class="para editable block" id="mayer_1.0-ch05_s01_s01_p02">Most commentators note that having agencies with rule-making power is a practical necessity: (1) Congress does not have the expertise or continuity to develop specialized knowledge in various areas (e.g., communications, the environment, aviation). (2) Because of this, it makes sense for Congress to set forth broad statutory guidance to an agency and delegate authority to the agency to propose rules that further the statutory purposes. (3) As long as Congress makes this delegating guidance sufficiently clear, it is not delegating improperly. If Congress’s guidelines are too vague or undefined, it is (in essence) giving away its constitutional power to some other group, and this it cannot do.</p>

        <h2 class="title editable block">Why Regulate the Economy at All?</h2>
        <p class="para editable block" id="mayer_1.0-ch05_s01_s02_p01">The market often does not work properly, as economists often note. Monopolies, for example, happen in the natural course of human events but are not always desirable. To fix this, well-conceived and objectively enforced competition law (what is called antitrust law in the United States) is needed.</p>
        <p class="para editable block" id="mayer_1.0-ch05_s01_s02_p02">Negative externalities must be “fixed,” as well. For example, as we see in tort law (<a class="xref" href="mayer_1.0-ch07#mayer_1.0-ch07">Chapter 7 "Introduction to Tort Law"</a>), people and business organizations often do things that impose costs (damages) on others, and the legal system will try—through the award of compensatory damages—to make fair adjustments. In terms of the ideal conditions for a free market, think of tort law as the legal system’s attempt to compensate for negative externalities: those costs imposed on people who have not voluntarily consented to bear those costs.</p>
        <p class="para editable block" id="mayer_1.0-ch05_s01_s02_p03">In terms of freedoms to enter or leave the market, the US constitutional guarantees of equal protection can prevent local, state, and federal governments from imposing discriminatory rules for commerce that would keep minorities, women, and gay people from full participation in business. For example, if the small town of Xenophobia, Colorado, passed a law that required all business owners and their employees to be Christian, heterosexual, and married, the equal protection clause (as well as numerous state and federal equal opportunity employment laws) would empower plaintiffs to go to court and have the law struck down as unconstitutional.</p>
        <p class="para editable block" id="mayer_1.0-ch05_s01_s02_p04">Knowing that information is power, we will see many laws administered by regulatory agencies that seek to level the playing field of economic competition by requiring disclosure of the most pertinent information for consumers (consumer protection laws), investors (securities laws), and citizens (e.g., the toxics release inventory laws in environmental law).</p>
        <div class="callout editable block" id="mayer_1.0-ch05_s01_s02_n01">
            <h3 class="title">Ideal Conditions for a Free Market</h3>
            <ol class="orderedlist" id="mayer_1.0-ch05_s01_s02_l01">
                <li>There are many buyers and many sellers, and none of them has a substantial share of the market.</li>
                <li>All buyers and sellers in the market are free to enter the market or leave it.</li>
                <li>All buyers and all sellers have full and perfect knowledge of what other buyers and sellers are up to, including knowledge of prices, quantity, and quality of all goods being bought or sold.</li>
                <li>The goods being sold in the market are similar enough to each other that participants do not have strong preferences as to which seller or buyer they deal with.</li>
                <li>The costs and benefits of making or using the goods that are exchanged in the market are borne only by those who buy or sell those goods and not by third parties or people “external” to the market transaction. (That is, there are no “externalities.”)</li>
                <li>All buyers and sellers are utility maximizers; each participant in the market tries to get as much as possible for as little as possible.</li>
                <li>There are no parties, institutions, or governmental units regulating the price, quantity, or quality of any of the goods being bought and sold in the market.</li>
            </ol>
        </div>
        <p class="para editable block" id="mayer_1.0-ch05_s01_s02_p05">In short, some forms of legislation and regulation are needed to counter a tendency toward consolidation of economic power and discriminatory attitudes toward certain individuals and groups (<a class="xref" href="mayer_1.0-ch50#mayer_1.0-ch50">Chapter 30 "Employment Law"</a>) and to insist that people and companies clean up their own messes and not hide information that would empower voluntary choices in the free market.</p>
        <p class="para editable block" id="mayer_1.0-ch05_s01_s02_p06">But there are additional reasons to regulate. For example, in economic systems, it is likely for natural monopolies to occur. These are where one firm can most efficiently supply all of the good or service. Having duplicate (or triplicate) systems for supplying electricity, for example, would be inefficient, so most states have a public utilities commission to determine both price and quality of service. This is direct regulation.</p>
        <p class="para editable block" id="mayer_1.0-ch05_s01_s02_p07">Sometimes destructive competition can result if there is no regulation. Banking and insurance are good examples of this. Without government regulation of banks (setting standards and methods), open and fierce competition would result in widespread bank failures. That would erode public confidence in banks and business generally. The current situation (circa 2011) of six major banks that are “too big to fail” is, however, an example of destructive <em class="emphasis">noncompetition.</em></p>
        <p class="para editable block" id="mayer_1.0-ch05_s01_s02_p08">Other market imperfections can yield a demand for regulation. For example, there is a need to regulate frequencies for public broadcast on radio, television, and other wireless transmissions (for police, fire, national defense, etc.). Many economists would also list an adequate supply of public goods as something that must be created by government. On its own, for example, the market would not provide public goods such as education, a highway system, lighthouses, a military for defense.</p>
        <p class="para editable block" id="mayer_1.0-ch05_s01_s02_p09">True laissez-faire capitalism—a market free from any regulation—would not try to deal with market imperfections and would also allow people to freely choose products, services, and other arrangements that historically have been deemed socially unacceptable. These would include making enforceable contracts for the sale and purchase of persons (slavery), sexual services, “street drugs” such as heroin or crack cocaine, votes for public office, grades for this course in business law, and even marriage partnership.</p>
        <p class="para editable block" id="mayer_1.0-ch05_s01_s02_p10">Thus the free market in actual terms—and not in theory—consists of commerce legally constrained by what is economically desirable and by what is socially desirable as well. Public policy objectives in the social arena include ensuring equal opportunity in employment, protecting employees from unhealthy or unsafe work environments, preserving environmental quality and resources, and protecting consumers from unsafe products. Sometimes these objectives are met by giving individuals statutory rights that can be used in bringing a complaint (e.g., Title VII of the Civil Rights Act of 1964, for employment discrimination), and sometimes they are met by creating agencies with the right to investigate and monitor and enforce statutory law and regulations created to enforce such law (e.g., the Environmental Protection Agency, for bringing a lawsuit against a polluting company).</p>

    <div class="section" id="mayer_1.0-ch05_s01_s03">
        <h2 class="title editable block">History of Federal Agencies</h2>
        <p class="para editable block" id="mayer_1.0-ch05_s01_s03_p01">Through the commerce clause in the US Constitution, Congress has the power to regulate trade between the states and with foreign nations. The earliest federal agency therefore dealt with trucking and railroads, to literally set the rules of the road for interstate commerce. The first federal agency, the Interstate Commerce Commission (ICC), was created in 1887. Congress delegated to the ICC the power to enforce federal laws against railroad rate discrimination and other unfair pricing practices. By the early part of this century, the ICC gained the power to fix rates. From the 1970s through 1995, however, Congress passed deregulatory measures, and the ICC was formally abolished in 1995, with its powers transferred to the Surface Transportation Board.</p>
        <p class="para editable block" id="mayer_1.0-ch05_s01_s03_p02">Beginning with the Federal Trade Commission (FTC) in 1914, Congress has created numerous other agencies, many of them familiar actors in American government. Today more than eighty-five federal agencies have jurisdiction to regulate some form of private activity. Most were created since 1930, and more than a third since 1960. A similar growth has occurred at the state level. Most states now have dozens of regulatory agencies, many of them overlapping in function with the federal bodies.</p>
    </div>
    <div class="section" id="mayer_1.0-ch05_s01_s04">
        <h2 class="title editable block">Classification of Agencies</h2>
        <p class="para editable block" id="mayer_1.0-ch05_s01_s04_p01">Independent agencies are different from federal executive departments and other executive agencies by their structural and functional characteristics. Most executive departments have a single director, administrator, or secretary appointed by the president of the United States. Independent agencies almost always have a commission or board consisting of five to seven members who share power over the agency. The president appoints the commissioners or board subject to Senate confirmation, but they often serve with staggered terms and often for longer terms than a usual four-year presidential term. They cannot be removed except for “good cause.” This means that most presidents will not get to appoint all the commissioners of a given independent agency. Most independent agencies have a statutory requirement of bipartisan membership on the commission, so the president cannot simply fill vacancies with members of his own political party.</p>
        <p class="para editable block" id="mayer_1.0-ch05_s01_s04_p02">In addition to the ICC and the FTC, the major independent agencies are the Federal Communications Commission (1934), Securities and Exchange Commission (1934), National Labor Relations Board (1935), and Environmental Protection Agency (1970). See <a class="xref" href="#mayer_1.0-ch05_s01_s02_n01">Note 5.4 "Ideal Conditions for a Free Market"</a> in the sidebar.</p>
        <p class="para editable block" id="mayer_1.0-ch05_s01_s04_p03">By contrast, members of executive branch agencies serve at the pleasure of the president and are therefore far more amenable to political control. One consequence of this distinction is that the rules that independent agencies promulgate may not be reviewed by the president or his staff—only Congress may directly overrule them—whereas the White House or officials in the various cabinet departments may oversee the work of the agencies contained within them (unless specifically denied the power by Congress).</p>
    </div>
    <div class="section" id="mayer_1.0-ch05_s01_s05">
        <h2 class="title editable block">Powers of Agencies</h2>
        <p class="para editable block" id="mayer_1.0-ch05_s01_s05_p01">Agencies have a variety of powers. Many of the original statutes that created them, like the Federal Communications Act, gave them licensing power. No party can enter into the productive activity covered by the act without prior license from the agency—for example, no utility can start up a nuclear power plant unless first approved by the Nuclear Regulatory Commission. In recent years, the move toward deregulation of the economy has led to diminution of some licensing power. Many agencies also have the authority to set the rates charged by companies subject to the agency’s jurisdiction. Finally, the agencies can regulate business practices. The FTC has general jurisdiction over all business in interstate commerce to monitor and root out “unfair acts” and “deceptive practices.” The Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) oversees the issuance of corporate securities and other investments and monitors the practices of the stock exchanges.</p>
        <p class="para editable block" id="mayer_1.0-ch05_s01_s05_p02">Unlike courts, administrative agencies are charged with the responsibility of carrying out a specific assignment or reaching a goal or set of goals. They are not to remain neutral on the various issues of the day; they must act. They have been given legislative powers because in a society growing ever more complex, Congress does not know how to legislate with the kind of detail that is necessary, nor would it have the time to approach all the sectors of society even if it tried. Precisely because they are to do what general legislative bodies cannot do, agencies are specialized bodies. Through years of experience in dealing with similar problems they accumulate a body of knowledge that they can apply to accomplish their statutory duties.</p>
        <p class="para editable block" id="mayer_1.0-ch05_s01_s05_p03">All administrative agencies have two different sorts of personnel. The heads, whether a single administrator or a collegial body of commissioners, are political appointees and serve for relatively limited terms. Below them is a more or less permanent staff—the bureaucracy. Much policy making occurs at the staff level, because these employees are in essential control of gathering facts and presenting data and argument to the commissioners, who wield the ultimate power of the agencies.</p>
    </div>
    <div class="section" id="mayer_1.0-ch05_s01_s06">
        <h2 class="title editable block">The Constitution and Agencies</h2>
        <p class="para editable block" id="mayer_1.0-ch05_s01_s06_p01">Congress can establish an agency through legislation. When Congress gives powers to an agency, the legislation is known as an <span class="margin_term"><a class="glossterm">enabling act</a><span class="glossdef">The legislative act that establishes an agency’s authority in a particular area of the economy.</span></span>. The concept that Congress can delegate power to an agency is known as the <span class="margin_term"><a class="glossterm">delegation doctrine</a><span class="glossdef">As a matter of constitutional law, the delegation doctrine declares that an agency can only exercise that power delegated to it by a constitutional authority.</span></span>. Usually, the agency will have all three kinds of power: executive, legislative, and judicial. (That is, the agency can set the rules that business must comply with, can investigate and prosecute those businesses, and can hold administrative hearings for violations of those rules. They are, in effect, rule maker, prosecutor, and judge.) Because agencies have all three types of governmental powers, important constitutional questions were asked when Congress first created them. The most important question was whether Congress was giving away its legislative power. Was the separation of powers violated if agencies had power to make rules that were equivalent to legislative statutes?</p>
        <p class="para editable block" id="mayer_1.0-ch05_s01_s06_p02">In 1935, in <em class="emphasis">Schechter Poultry Corp. v. United States</em>, the Supreme Court overturned the National Industrial Recovery Act on the ground that the congressional delegation of power was too broad.<span class="footnote" id="mayer_1.0-fn05_001"><em class="emphasis">Schechter Poultry Corp. v. United States</em>, 295 US 495 (1935).</span> Under the law, industry trade groups were granted the authority to devise a code of fair competition for the entire industry, and these codes became law if approved by the president. No administrative body was created to scrutinize the arguments for a particular code, to develop evidence, or to test one version of a code against another. Thus it was unconstitutional for the Congress to transfer all of its legislative powers to an agency. In later decisions, it was made clear that Congress could delegate some of its legislative powers, but only if the delegation of authority was not overly broad.</p>
        <p class="para editable block" id="mayer_1.0-ch05_s01_s06_p03">Still, some congressional enabling acts are very broad, such as the enabling legislation for the Occupational Safety and Health Administration (OSHA), which is given the authority to make rules to provide for safe and healthful working conditions in US workplaces. Such a broad initiative power gives OSHA considerable discretion. But, as noted in <a class="xref" href="mayer_1.0-ch05_s02#mayer_1.0-ch05_s02">Section 5.2 "Controlling Administrative Agencies"</a>, there are both executive and judicial controls over administrative agency activities, as well as ongoing control by Congress through funding and the continuing oversight of agencies, both in hearings and through subsequent statutory amendments.</p>

            <h3 class="title">Key Takeaway</h3>
            <p class="para" id="mayer_1.0-ch05_s01_s06_p04">Congress creates administrative agencies through enabling acts. In these acts, Congress must delegate authority by giving the agency some direction as to what it wants the agency to do. Agencies are usually given broad powers to investigate, set standards (promulgating regulations), and enforce those standards. Most agencies are executive branch agencies, but some are independent.</p>
