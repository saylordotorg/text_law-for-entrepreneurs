        <h2 class="title editable block">A Fixture of Every Major Legal System</h2>
        <p class="para editable block" id="mayer_1.0-ch43_s01_s01_p01">Like partnership, the corporation is an ancient concept, recognized in the Code of Hammurabi, and to some degree a fixture in every other major legal system since then. The first corporations were not business enterprises; instead, they were associations for religious and governmental ends in which perpetual existence was a practical requirement. Thus until relatively late in legal history, kings, popes, and jurists assumed that corporations could be created only by political or ecclesiastical authority and that corporations were creatures of the state or church. By the seventeenth century, with feudalism on the wane and business enterprise becoming a growing force, kings extracted higher taxes and intervened more directly in the affairs of businesses by refusing to permit them to operate in corporate form except by royal grant. This came to be known as the <span class="margin_term"><a class="glossterm">concession theory</a><span class="glossdef">Incorporation was a concession given by royal grant of a sovereign.</span></span>, because incorporation was a concession from the sovereign.</p>
        <p class="para editable block" id="mayer_1.0-ch43_s01_s01_p02">The most important concessions, or charters, were those given to the giant foreign trading companies, including the Russia Company (1554), the British East India Company (1600), Hudson’s Bay Company (1670, and still operating in Canada under the name “the Bay”), and the South Sea Company (1711). These were <span class="margin_term"><a class="glossterm">joint-stock companies</a><span class="glossdef">Companies in which stock or company funds are held jointly.</span></span>—that is, individuals contributed capital to the enterprise, which traded on behalf of all the stockholders. Originally, trading companies were formed for single voyages, but the advantages of a continuing fund of capital soon became apparent. Also apparent was the legal characteristic that above all led shareholders to subscribe to the stock: limited liability. They risked only the cash they put in, not their personal fortunes.</p>
        <p class="para editable block" id="mayer_1.0-ch43_s01_s01_p03">Some companies were wildly successful. The British East India Company paid its original investors a fourfold return between 1683 and 1692. But perhaps nothing excited the imagination of the British more than the discovery of gold bullion aboard a Spanish shipwreck; 150 companies were quickly formed to salvage the sunken Spanish treasure. Though most of these companies were outright frauds, they ignited the search for easy wealth by a public unwary of the risks. In particular, the South Sea Company promised the sun and the moon: in return for a monopoly over the slave trade to the West Indies, it told an enthusiastic public that it would retire the public debt and make every person rich.</p>
        <p class="para editable block" id="mayer_1.0-ch43_s01_s01_p04">In 1720, a fervor gripped London that sent stock prices soaring. Beggars and earls alike speculated from January to August; and then the bubble burst. Without considering the ramifications, Parliament had enacted the highly restrictive Bubble Act, which was supposed to do away with unchartered <strong class="emphasis bold">joint-stock</strong> companies. When the government prosecuted four companies under the act for having fraudulently obtained charters, the public panicked and stock prices came tumbling down, resulting in history’s first modern financial crisis.</p>
        <p class="para editable block" id="mayer_1.0-ch43_s01_s01_p05">As a consequence, corporate development was severely retarded in England. Distrustful of the chartered company, Parliament issued few corporate charters, and then only for public or quasi-public undertakings, such as transportation, insurance, and banking enterprises. Corporation law languished: William Blackstone devoted less than 1 percent of his immensely influential <em class="emphasis">Commentaries on the Law of England</em> (1765) to corporations and omitted altogether any discussion of limited liability. In <em class="emphasis">The Wealth of Nations</em> (1776), Adam Smith doubted that the use of corporations would spread. England did not repeal the Bubble Act until 1825, and then only because the value of true incorporation had become apparent from the experience of its former colonies.</p>
    </div>
    <div class="section" id="mayer_1.0-ch43_s01_s02">
        <h2 class="title editable block">US Corporation Formation</h2>
        <p class="para editable block" id="mayer_1.0-ch43_s01_s02_p01">The United States remained largely unaffected by the Bubble Act. Incorporation was granted only by special acts of state legislatures, even well into the nineteenth century, but many such acts were passed. Before the Revolution, perhaps fewer than a dozen business corporations existed throughout the thirteen colonies. During the 1790s, two hundred businesses were incorporated, and their numbers swelled thereafter. The theory that incorporation should not be accomplished except through special legislation began to give way. As industrial development accelerated in the mid-1800s, it was possible in many states to incorporate by adhering to the requirements of a general statute. Indeed, by the late nineteenth century, all but three states constitutionally <em class="emphasis">forbade</em> their legislatures from chartering companies through special enactments.</p>
        <p class="para editable block" id="mayer_1.0-ch43_s01_s02_p02">The US Supreme Court contributed importantly to the development of corporate law. In <em class="emphasis">Gibbons v. Ogden</em>,<span class="footnote" id="mayer_1.0-fn43_001"><em class="emphasis">Gibbons v. Ogden</em>, 22 U.S. 1 (1824).</span> a groundbreaking case, the Court held that the Commerce Clause of the US Constitution (Article I, Section 8, Clause 3) granted Congress the power to regulate interstate commerce. However, in <em class="emphasis">Paul v. Virginia</em>,<span class="footnote" id="mayer_1.0-fn43_002"><em class="emphasis">Paul v. Virginia</em>, 75 U.S. 168 (1868).</span> the Court said that a state could prevent corporations not chartered there—that is, <strong class="emphasis bold">out-of-state or</strong> <span class="margin_term"><a class="glossterm">foreign corporations</a><span class="glossdef">A company incorporated outside the state in which it is doing business.</span></span>—from engaging in what it considered the local, and not interstate, business of issuing insurance policies. The inference made by many was that states could not bar foreign corporations engaged in <em class="emphasis">interstate</em> business from their borders.</p>
        <p class="para editable block" id="mayer_1.0-ch43_s01_s02_p03">This decision brought about a competition in corporation laws. The early general laws had imposed numerous restrictions. The breadth of corporate enterprise was limited, ceilings were placed on total capital and indebtedness, incorporators were required to have residence in the state, the duration of the company often was not perpetual but was limited to a term of years or until a particular undertaking was completed, and the powers of management were circumscribed. These restrictions and limitations were thought to be necessary to protect the citizenry of the chartering legislature’s own state. But once it became clear that companies chartered in one state could operate in others, states began in effect to “sell” incorporation for tax revenues.</p>
        <p class="para editable block" id="mayer_1.0-ch43_s01_s02_p04">New Jersey led the way in 1875 with a general incorporation statute that greatly liberalized the powers of management and lifted many of the former restrictions. The Garden State was ultimately eclipsed by Delaware, which in 1899 enacted the most liberal corporation statute in the country, so that to the present day there are thousands of “Delaware corporations” that maintain no presence in the state other than an address on file with the secretary of state in Dover.</p>
        <p class="para editable block" id="mayer_1.0-ch43_s01_s02_p05">During the 1920s, the National Conference of Commissioners on Uniform State Laws drafted a Uniform Business Corporation Act, the final version of which was released in 1928. It was not widely adopted, but it did provide the basis during the 1930s for revisions of some state laws, including those in California, Illinois, Michigan, Minnesota, and Pennsylvania. By that time, in the midst of the Great Depression, the federal government for the first time intruded into corporate law in a major way by creating federal agencies, most notably the Securities and Exchange Commission in 1934, with power to regulate the interstate issuance of corporate stock.</p>

        <h2 class="title editable block">Corporate Law Today</h2>
        <p class="para editable block" id="mayer_1.0-ch43_s01_s03_p01">Following World War II, most states revised their general corporation laws. A significant development for states was the preparation of the Model Business Corporation Act by the American Bar Association’s Committee on Corporate Laws. About half of the states have adopted all or major portions of the act. The 2005 version of this act, the Revised Model Business Corporation Act (RMBCA), will be referred to throughout our discussion of corporation law.</p>

            <h3 class="title">Key Takeaway</h3>
            <p class="para" id="mayer_1.0-ch43_s01_s03_p02">Corporations have their roots in political and religious authority. The concept of limited liability and visions of financial rewards fueled the popularity of joint-stock companies, particularly trading companies, in late-seventeenth- and early eighteenth-century England. The English Parliament successfully enacted the Bubble Act in 1720 to curb the formation of these companies; the restrictions weren’t loosened until over one hundred years later, after England viewed the success of corporations in its former colonies. Although early corporate laws in the United States were fairly restrictive, once states began to “sell” incorporation for tax revenues, the popularity of liberal and corporate-friendly laws caught on, especially in Delaware beginning in 1899. A corporation remains a creature of the state—that is, the state in which it is incorporated. Delaware remains the state of choice because more corporations are registered there than in any other state.</p>
