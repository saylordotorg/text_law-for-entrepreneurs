    <p class="para editable block" id="mayer_1.0-ch27_p02">This chapter and the three that follow are devoted to debtor-creditor relations. In this chapter, we focus on the consumer credit transaction. <a class="xref" href="mayer_1.0-ch28#mayer_1.0-ch28">Chapter 33 "Secured Transactions and Suretyship"</a> and <a class="xref" href="mayer_1.0-ch29#mayer_1.0-ch29">Chapter 34 "Mortgages and Nonconsensual Liens"</a> explore different types of security that a creditor might require. <a class="xref" href="mayer_1.0-ch30#mayer_1.0-ch30">Chapter 35 "Bankruptcy"</a> examines debtors’ and creditors’ rights under bankruptcy law.</p>
    <p class="para editable block" id="mayer_1.0-ch27_p03">The amount of consumer debt, or <span class="margin_term"><a class="glossterm">household debt</a><span class="glossdef">Debt owed by consumers.</span></span>, owed by Americans to mortgage lenders, stores, automobile dealers, and other merchants who sell on credit is difficult to ascertain. One reads that the average household <em class="emphasis">credit card</em> debt (not including mortgages, auto loans, and student loans) in 2009 was almost $16,000.<span class="footnote" id="mayer_1.0-fn27_001">Ben Woolsey and Matt Schulz, <em class="emphasis">Credit Card Statistics, Industry Statistics, Debt Statistics,</em> August 24, 2010, <a class="link" target="_blank" href="http://www.creditcards.com/credit-card-news/credit-card-industry-facts-personal-debt-statistics-1276.php">http://www.creditcards.com/credit-card-news/credit-card-industry-facts-personal-debt-statistics-1276.php</a>. This is “calculated by dividing the total revolving debt in the U.S. ($852.6 billion as of March 2010 data, as listed in the Federal Reserve’s May 2010 report on consumer credit) by the estimated number of households carrying credit card debt (54 million).”</span> Or maybe it was $10,000.<span class="footnote" id="mayer_1.0-fn27_002">Deborah Fowles, “Your Monthly Credit Card Minimum Payments May Double,” About.com Financial Planning, <a class="link" target="_blank" href="http://financialplan.about.com/od/creditcarddebt/a/CCMinimums.htm">http://financialplan.about.com/od/creditcarddebt/a/CCMinimums.htm</a>.</span> Or maybe it was $7,300.<span class="footnote" id="mayer_1.0-fn27_003">Index Credit Cards, <em class="emphasis">Credit Card Debt</em>, February 9, 2010, <a class="link" target="_blank" href="http://www.indexcreditcards.com/creditcarddebt">http://www.indexcreditcards.com/creditcarddebt</a>.</span> But probably focusing on the <em class="emphasis">average</em> household debt is not very helpful: 55 percent of households have no credit card debt at all, and the <em class="emphasis">median</em> debt is $1,900.<span class="footnote" id="mayer_1.0-fn27_004">Liz Pulliam Weston, “The Big Lie about Credit Card Debt,” <em class="emphasis">MSN Money</em>, July 30, 2007.</span></p>
    <p class="para editable block" id="mayer_1.0-ch27_p04">In 2007, the total household debt owed by Americans was $13.3 trillion, according to the Federal Reserve Board. That is really an incomprehensible number: suffice it to say, then, that the availability of credit is an important factor in the US economy, and not surprisingly, a number of statutes have been enacted over the years to protect consumers both before and after signing credit agreements.</p>
    <p class="para editable block" id="mayer_1.0-ch27_p05">The statutes tend to fall within three broad categories. First, several statutes are especially important when a consumer enters into a credit transaction. These include laws that regulate credit costs, the credit application, and the applicant’s right to check a credit record. Second, after a consumer has contracted for credit, certain statutes give a consumer the right to cancel the contract and correct billing mistakes. Third, if the consumer fails to pay a debt, the creditor has several traditional debt collection remedies that today are tightly regulated by the government.</p>
