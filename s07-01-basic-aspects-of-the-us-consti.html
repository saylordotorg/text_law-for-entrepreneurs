        <h2 class="title editable block">The Constitution as Reflecting American Values</h2>
        <p class="para editable block" id="mayer_1.0-ch04_s01_s01_p01">In the US, the one document to which all public officials and military personnel pledge their unswerving allegiance is the Constitution. If you serve, you are asked to “support and defend” the Constitution “against all enemies, foreign and domestic.” The oath usually includes a statement that you swear that this oath is taken freely, honestly, and without “any purpose of evasion.” This loyalty oath may be related to a time—fifty years ago—when “un-American” activities were under investigation in Congress and the press; the fear of communism (as antithetical to American values and principles) was paramount. As you look at the Constitution and how it affects the legal environment of business, please consider what basic values it may impart to us and what makes it uniquely American and worth defending “against all enemies, foreign and domestic.”</p>
        <p class="para editable block" id="mayer_1.0-ch04_s01_s01_p02">In Article I, the Constitution places the legislature first and prescribes the ways in which representatives are elected to public office. Article I balances influence in the federal legislature between large states and small states by creating a Senate in which the smaller states (by population) as well as the larger states have two votes. In Article II, the Constitution sets forth the powers and responsibilities of the branch—the presidency—and makes it clear that the president should be the commander in chief of the armed forces. Article II also gives states rather than individuals (through the Electoral College) a clear role in the election process. Article III creates the federal judiciary, and the Bill of Rights, adopted in 1791, makes clear that individual rights must be preserved against activities of the federal government. In general, the idea of rights is particularly strong.</p>
        <p class="para editable block" id="mayer_1.0-ch04_s01_s01_p03">The Constitution itself speaks of rights in fairly general terms, and the judicial interpretation of various rights has been in flux. The “right” of a person to own another person was notably affirmed by the Supreme Court in the <em class="emphasis">Dred Scott</em> decision in 1857.<span class="footnote" id="mayer_1.0-fn04_001">In <em class="emphasis">Scott v. Sanford</em> (the Dred Scott decision), the court states that Scott should remain a slave, that as a slave he is not a citizen of the United States and thus not eligible to bring suit in a federal court, and that as a slave he is personal property and thus has never been free.</span> The “right” of a child to freely contract for long, tedious hours of work was upheld by the court in <em class="emphasis">Hammer v. Dagenhart</em> in 1918. Both decisions were later repudiated, just as the decision that a woman has a “right” to an abortion in the first trimester of pregnancy could later be repudiated if <em class="emphasis">Roe v. Wade</em> is overturned by the Supreme Court.<span class="footnote" id="mayer_1.0-fn04_002"><em class="emphasis">Roe v. Wade</em>, 410 US 113 (1973).</span></p>

        <h2 class="title editable block">General Structure of the Constitution</h2>
        <p class="para editable block" id="mayer_1.0-ch04_s01_s02_p01">Look at the Constitution. Notice that there are seven articles, starting with Article I (legislative powers), Article II (executive branch), and Article III (judiciary). Notice that there is no separate article for administrative agencies. The Constitution also declares that it is “the supreme Law of the Land” (Article VI). Following Article VII are the ten amendments adopted in 1791 that are referred to as the Bill of Rights. Notice also that in 1868, a new amendment, the Fourteenth, was adopted, requiring states to provide “due process” and “equal protection of the laws” to citizens of the United States.</p>
    </div>
    <div class="section" id="mayer_1.0-ch04_s01_s03">
        <h2 class="title editable block">Federalism</h2>
        <p class="para editable block" id="mayer_1.0-ch04_s01_s03_p01">The partnership created in the Constitution between the states and the federal government is called <span class="margin_term"><a class="glossterm">federalism</a><span class="glossdef">The idea, built into the structure of the Constitution, that states and the federal government have concurrent powers. In effect, federalism is the concept of shared governance between the states and the federal government.</span></span>. The Constitution is a document created by the states in which certain powers are delegated to the national government, and other powers are reserved to the states. This is made explicit in the Tenth Amendment.</p>
    </div>
    <div class="section" id="mayer_1.0-ch04_s01_s04">
        <h2 class="title editable block">Separation of Powers and Judicial Review</h2>
        <p class="para editable block" id="mayer_1.0-ch04_s01_s04_p01">Because the Founding Fathers wanted to ensure that no single branch of the government, especially the executive branch, would be ascendant over the others, they created various checks and balances to ensure that each of the three principal branches had ways to limit or modify the power of the others. This is known as the <span class="margin_term"><a class="glossterm">separation of powers</a><span class="glossdef">In the original design of the Constitution, the executive, legislative, and judicial branches were all given powers that could modify or limit the powers of the other branches of government. For example, the president wields a veto power over congressional legislation.</span></span>. Thus the president retains veto power, but the House of Representatives is entrusted with the power to initiate spending bills.</p>
        <p class="para editable block" id="mayer_1.0-ch04_s01_s04_p02">Power sharing was evident in the basic design of Congress, the federal legislative branch. The basic power imbalance was between the large states (with greater population) and the smaller ones (such as Delaware). The smaller ones feared a loss of sovereignty if they could be outvoted by the larger ones, so the federal legislature was constructed to guarantee two Senate seats for every state, no matter how small. The Senate was also given great responsibility in ratifying treaties and judicial nominations. The net effect of this today is that senators from a very small number of states can block treaties and other important legislation. The power of small states is also magnified by the Senate’s cloture rule, which currently requires sixty out of one hundred senators to vote to bring a bill to the floor for an up-or-down vote.</p>
        <p class="para editable block" id="mayer_1.0-ch04_s01_s04_p03">Because the Constitution often speaks in general terms (with broad phrases such as “due process” and “equal protection”), reasonable people have disagreed as to how those terms apply in specific cases. The United States is unique among industrialized democracies in having a Supreme Court that reserves for itself that exclusive power to interpret what the Constitution means. The famous case of <em class="emphasis">Marbury v. Madison</em> began that tradition in 1803, when the Supreme Court had marginal importance in the new republic. The decision in <em class="emphasis">Bush v. Gore</em>, decided in December of 2000, illustrates the power of the court to shape our destiny as a nation. In that case, the court overturned a ruling by the Florida Supreme Court regarding the way to proceed on a recount of the Florida vote for the presidency. The court’s ruling was purportedly based on the “equal protection of the laws” provision in the Fourteenth Amendment.</p>
        <p class="para editable block" id="mayer_1.0-ch04_s01_s04_p04">From <em class="emphasis">Marbury</em> to the present day, the Supreme Court has articulated the view that the US Constitution sets the framework for all other US laws, whether statutory or judicially created. Thus any statute (or portion thereof) or legal ruling (judicial or administrative) in conflict with the Constitution is not enforceable. And as the <em class="emphasis">Bush v. Gore</em> decision indicates, the states are not entirely free to do what they might choose; their own sovereignty is limited by their union with the other states in a federal sovereign.</p>
        <p class="para editable block" id="mayer_1.0-ch04_s01_s04_p05">If the Supreme Court makes a “bad decision” as to what the Constitution means, it is not easily overturned. Either the court must change its mind (which it seldom does) or two-thirds of Congress and three-fourths of the states must make an amendment (Article V).</p>
        <p class="para editable block" id="mayer_1.0-ch04_s01_s04_p06">Because the Supreme Court has this power of judicial review, there have been many arguments about how it should be exercised and what kind of “philosophy” a Supreme Court justice should have. President Richard Nixon often said that a Supreme Court justice should “strictly construe” the Constitution and not add to its language. Finding law in the Constitution was “judicial activism” rather than “judicial restraint.” The general philosophy behind the call for “strict constructionist” justices is that legislatures make laws in accord with the wishes of the majority, and so unelected judges should not make law according to their own views and values. Nixon had in mind the 1960s Warren court, which “found” rights in the Constitution that were not specifically mentioned—the right of privacy, for example. In later years, critics of the Rehnquist court would charge that it “found” rights that were not specifically mentioned, such as the right of states to be free from federal antidiscrimination laws. See, for example, <em class="emphasis">Kimel v. Florida Board of Regents</em>, or the <em class="emphasis">Citizens United v. Federal Election Commission</em> case (<a class="xref" href="mayer_1.0-ch04_s06#mayer_1.0-ch04_s06_s05">Section 4.6.5</a>), which held that corporations are “persons” with “free speech rights” that include spending unlimited amounts of money in campaign donations and political advocacy.<span class="footnote" id="mayer_1.0-fn04_003"><em class="emphasis">Kimel v. Florida Board of Regents</em>, 528 US 62 (2000).</span></p>
        <p class="para editable block" id="mayer_1.0-ch04_s01_s04_p07">Because <em class="emphasis">Roe v. Wade</em> has been so controversial, this chapter includes a seminal case on “the right of privacy,” <em class="emphasis">Griswold v. Connecticut</em>, <a class="xref" href="mayer_1.0-ch04_s06#mayer_1.0-ch04_s06_s01">Section 4.6.1</a>. Was the court was correct in recognizing a “right of privacy” in Griswold? This may not seem like a “business case,” but consider: the manufacture and distribution of birth control devices is a highly profitable (and legal) business in every US state. Moreover, Griswold illustrates another important and much-debated concept in US constitutional law: substantive due process (see <a class="xref" href="mayer_1.0-ch04_s05#mayer_1.0-ch04_s05_s03">Section 4.5.3 "Fifth Amendment"</a>). The problem of judicial review and its proper scope is brought into sharp focus in the abortion controversy. Abortion became a lucrative service business after <em class="emphasis">Roe v. Wade</em> was decided in 1973. That has gradually changed, with state laws that have limited rather than overruled <em class="emphasis">Roe v. Wade</em> and with persistent antiabortion protests, killings of abortion doctors, and efforts to publicize the human nature of the fetuses being aborted. The key here is to understand that there is no <em class="emphasis">explicit</em> mention in the Constitution of any right of privacy. As Justice Harry Blackmun argued in his majority opinion in <em class="emphasis">Roe v. Wade</em>,</p>
        <span class="blockquote block" id="mayer_1.0-ch04_s01_s04_bl01">
            <p class="para editable" id="mayer_1.0-ch04_s01_s04_p08">The Constitution does not explicitly mention any right of privacy. In a line of decisions, however, the Court has recognized that a right of personal privacy or a guarantee of certain areas or zones of privacy, does exist under the Constitution.…[T]hey also make it clear that the right has some extension to activities relating to marriage…procreation…contraception…family relationships…and child rearing and education.…The right of privacy…is broad enough to encompass a woman’s decision whether or not to terminate her pregnancy.</p>
        </span>
        <p class="para editable block" id="mayer_1.0-ch04_s01_s04_p09">In short, justices interpreting the Constitution wield quiet yet enormous power through judicial review. In deciding that the right of privacy applied to a woman’s decision to abort in the first trimester, the Supreme Court did not act on the basis of a popular mandate or clear and unequivocal language in the Constitution, and it made illegal any state or federal legislative or executive action contrary to its interpretation. Only a constitutional amendment or the court’s repudiation of <em class="emphasis">Roe v. Wade</em> as a precedent could change that interpretation.</p>

            <h3 class="title">Key Takeaway</h3>
            <p class="para" id="mayer_1.0-ch04_s01_s04_p10">The Constitution gives voice to the idea that people have basic rights and that a civilian president is also the commander in chief of the armed forces. It gives instructions as to how the various branches of government must share power and also tries to balance power between the states and the federal government. It does not expressly allow for judicial review, but the Supreme Court’s ability to declare what laws are (or are not) constitutional has given the judicial branch a kind of power not seen in other industrialized democracies.</p>

                <li>Suppose the Supreme Court declares that Congress and the president cannot authorize the indefinite detention of terrorist suspects without a trial of some sort, whether military or civilian. Suppose also that the people of the United States favor such indefinite detention and that Congress wants to pass a law rebuking the court’s decision.
