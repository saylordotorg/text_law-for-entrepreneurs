Large partnerships can fend for themselves by drafting partnership agreements that suit their special needs.” Donald J. Weidner, “RUPA and Fiduciary Duty: The Texture of Relationship,” <em class="emphasis">Law and Contemporary Problems</em> 58, no. 2 (1995): 81, 83.</span> The Uniform Partnership Act (UPA) and the Revised Uniform Partnership Act (RUPA) do not dictate what the relations among partners must be; the acts supply rules in the event that the partners have not done so for themselves. In this area, it is especially important for the partners to elaborate their agreement in writing. If the partners should happen to continue their business beyond the term fixed for it in their agreement, the terms of the agreement continue to apply.</p>

        <p class="para editable block" id="mayer_1.0-ch41_s01_s01_p01">Among the duties partners owe each other, six may be called out here: (1) the duty to serve, (2) the duty of loyalty, (3) the duty of care, (4) the duty of obedience, (5) the duty to inform copartners, and (6) the duty to account to the partnership. These are all very similar to the duty owed by an agent to the principal, as partnership law is based on agency concepts.<span class="footnote" id="mayer_1.0-fn41_002">Revised Uniform Partnership Act, Section 404, Comment 3: “Indeed, the law of partnership reflects the broader law of principal and agent, under which every agent is a fiduciary.”</span></p>

            <p class="para editable block" id="mayer_1.0-ch41_s01_s01_s01_p01">Unless otherwise agreed, expressly or impliedly, a partner is expected to work for the firm. The partnership, after all, is a profit-making co-venture, and it would not do for one to loaf about and still expect to get paid. For example, suppose Joan takes her two-week vacation from the horse-stable partnership she operates with Sarah and Sandra. Then she does not return for four months because she has gone horseback riding in the Southwest. She might end up having to pay if the partnership hired a substitute to do her work.</p>

            <p class="para editable block" id="mayer_1.0-ch41_s01_s01_s02_p01">In general, this requires partners to put the firm’s interests ahead of their own.

Judge Benjamin Cardozo, in an often-quoted phrase, called the fiduciary duty “something stricter than the morals of the market place. Not honesty alone, but the punctilio of an honor the most sensitive, is then the standard of behavior.”<span class="footnote" id="mayer_1.0-fn41_003"><em class="emphasis">Meinhard v. Salmon</em>, 164 N.E. 545 (N.Y. 1928).</span> Breach of the fiduciary duty gives rise to a claim for compensatory, consequential, and incidental damages; recoupment of compensation; and—rarely—punitive damages.

                <p class="para editable block" id="mayer_1.0-ch41_s01_s01_s02_s01_p01">Under UPA, all partners are fiduciaries of each other—they are all principals and agents of each other—though the word <em class="emphasis">fiduciary</em> was not used except in the <em class="emphasis">heading</em> to Section 21. The section reads, “Every partner must account to the partnership for any benefit, and hold as trustee for it any profits derived by him without the consent of the other partners from any transaction connected with the formation, conduct, or liquidation of the partnership or from any use by him of its property.”</p>
                <p class="para editable block" id="mayer_1.0-ch41_s01_s01_s02_s01_p02">Section 404 of RUPA specifically provides that a partner has a fiduciary duty to the partnership and other partners. It imposes the fiduciary standard on the duty of loyalty in three circumstances:</p>
                <span class="blockquote block" id="mayer_1.0-ch41_s01_s01_s02_s01_bl01">

                <p class="para editable block" id="mayer_1.0-ch41_s01_s01_s02_s02_p01">This sets out a fairly limited scope for application of the fiduciary standard, which is reasonable because partners do not delegate open-ended control to their copartners. Further, there are some specific limits on how far the fiduciary duty reaches (which means parties are held to the lower standard of “good faith”). Here are two examples. First, RUPA—unlike UPA—does not extend to the <em class="emphasis">formation</em> of the partnership; Comment 2 to RUPA Section 404 says that would be inappropriate because then the parties are “really dealing at arm’s length.” Second, fiduciary duty doesn’t apply to a dissociated partner (one who leaves the firm—discussed in <a class="xref" href="mayer_1.0-ch41_s03#mayer_1.0-ch41_s03_s02_s01">Section 23 "Dissociation"</a>) who can immediately begin competing without the others’ consent; and it doesn’t apply if a partner violates the standard “merely because the partner’s conduct furthers the partner’s own interest.”<span class="footnote" id="mayer_1.0-fn41_004">RUPA, Section 503(b)(2); RUPA, Section 404 (e).</span> Moreover, the partnership agreement may eliminate the duty of loyalty so long as that is not “manifestly unreasonable.”<span class="footnote" id="mayer_1.0-fn41_005">RUPA, Section 103(2)(c).</span></p>

                <p class="para editable block" id="mayer_1.0-ch41_s01_s01_s02_s03_p01">The duty of loyalty means, again, that partners must put the firm’s interest above their own. Thus it is held that a partner</p>

                    <li>must maintain the confidentiality of partnership information.</li>

        <div class="section" id="mayer_1.0-ch41_s01_s01_s03">

            <p class="para editable block" id="mayer_1.0-ch41_s01_s01_s03_p01">Stemming from its roots in agency law, partnership law also imposes a duty of care on partners. Partners are to faithfully serve to the best of their ability. Section 404 of RUPA imposes the fiduciary standard on the duty of care, but rather confusingly: how does the “punctilio of an honor the most sensitive”—as Judge Cardozo described that standard—apply when under RUPA Section 404(c) the “the duty of care…is limited to refraining from engaging in grossly negligent or reckless conduct, intentional misconduct, or a knowing violation of law”? Recognize that a person can attend to business both loyally and negligently. For example, Alice Able, a partner in a law firm who is not very familiar with the firm’s computerized bookkeeping system, attempts to trace a missing check and in so doing erases a month’s worth of records. She has not breached her duty of care: maybe she was negligent, but not grossly negligent under RUPA Section 404(c). The partnership agreement may reduce the duty of care so long as it is not “unreasonably reduce[d]”; it may increase the standard too.<span class="footnote" id="mayer_1.0-fn41_006">RUPA, Section 103(2)(d); RUPA, Section 103.</span></p>

            <p class="para editable block" id="mayer_1.0-ch41_s01_s01_s04_p01">The partnership is a contractual relationship among the partners; they are all agents and principals of each other. Expressly or impliedly that means no partner can disobey the partnership agreement or fail to follow any properly made partnership decision. This includes the duty to act within the authority expressly or impliedly given in the partnership agreement, and a partner is responsible to the other partners for damages or losses arising from unauthorized activities.</p>

        <p class="para editable block" id="mayer_1.0-ch41_s01_s02_p01">Necessarily, for every duty owed there is a correlative right. So, for example, if a partner has a duty to account, the other partners and the partnership have a right to an accounting. Beyond that, partners have recognized rights affecting the operation of the partnership.</p>
        <p class="para editable block" id="mayer_1.0-ch41_s01_s02_p02">Here we may call out the following salient rights: (1) to distributions of money, (2) to management, (3) to choose copartners, (4) to property of the partnership, (5) to assign partnership interest, and (6) to enforce duties and rights.</p>
        <div class="section" id="mayer_1.0-ch41_s01_s02_s01">

            <p class="para editable block" id="mayer_1.0-ch41_s01_s02_s01_p01">The purpose of a partnership is ultimately to distribute “money or other property from a partnership to a partner in the partner’s capacity.”<span class="footnote" id="mayer_1.0-fn41_009">RUPA, Section 101(3).</span> There are, however, various types of money distributions, including profits (and losses), indemnification, capital, and compensation.</p>
            <div class="section" id="mayer_1.0-ch41_s01_s02_s01_s01">
                <h2 class="title editable block">Right to Profits (and Losses)</h2>
                <p class="para editable block" id="mayer_1.0-ch41_s01_s02_s01_s01_p01">Profits and losses may be shared according to any formula on which the partners agree. For example, the partnership agreement may provide that two senior partners are entitled to 35 percent each of the profit from the year and the two junior partners are entitled to 15 percent each. The next year the percentages will be adjusted based on such things as number of new clients garnered, number of billable hours, or amount of income generated. Eventually, the senior partners might retire and each be entitled to 2 percent of the firm’s income, and the previous junior partners become senior, with new junior partners admitted.</p>
                <p class="para editable block" id="mayer_1.0-ch41_s01_s02_s01_s01_p02">If no provision is stated, then under RUPA Section 401(b), “each partner is entitled to an equal share of the partnership profits and is chargeable with a share of the partnership losses in proportion to the partner’s share of the profits.” Section 18(a) of the Uniform Partnership Act is to the same effect. The right to share in the profits is the reason people want to “make partner”: a partner will reap the benefits of other partners’ successes (and pay for their failures too). A person working for the firm who is not a partner is an associate and usually only gets only a salary.</p>

The law provides that “the partnership must reimburse a partner for an advance of funds beyond the amount of the partner’s agreed capital contribution, thereby treating the advance as a loan.”<span class="footnote" id="mayer_1.0-fn41_010">UPA, Section 18(c); RUPA, Section 401(d).</span> A partner may get a return of capital under UPA after creditors are paid off if the business is wound down and terminated.<span class="footnote" id="mayer_1.0-fn41_011">UPA, Section 40(b); RUPA, Section 807(b).</span></p>

            <p class="para editable block" id="mayer_1.0-ch41_s01_s02_s03_p01">A business partnership is often analogized to a marriage partnership. In both there is a relationship of trust and confidence between (or among) the parties; in both the poor judgment, negligence, or dishonesty of one can create liabilities on the other(s). In a good marriage or good partnership, the partners are friends, whatever else the legal relationship imposes. Thus no one is compelled to accept a partner against his or her will. Section 401(i) of RUPA provides, “A person may become a partner only with the consent of all of the partners.” UPA Section 18(g) is to the same effect; the doctrine is called <span class="margin_term"><a class="glossterm">delectus personae</a><span class="glossdef">The theory that a new partner can only be admitted to a firm with the unanimous consent of all.</span></span>. The freedom to select new partners, however, is not absolute.

As spelled out in Section 25(2), the specific property interest of a tenant in partnership vests in the surviving partners, not in the heirs.

            <p class="para editable block" id="mayer_1.0-ch41_s01_s02_s05_p01">One of the hallmarks of the capitalistic system is that people should be able to dispose of their property interests more or less as they see fit. Partnership interests may be assigned to some extent.</p>

                <h2 class="title editable block">Voluntary Assignment</h2>
                <p class="para editable block" id="mayer_1.0-ch41_s01_s02_s05_s01_p01">At common law, assignment of a partner’s interest in the business—for example, as a mortgage in return for a loan—would result in a legal dissolution of the partnership. Thus in the absence of UPA, which changed the law, Baker’s decision to mortgage his interest in the car dealership in return for a $20,000 loan from his bank would mean that the three—Able, Baker, and Carr—were no longer partners. Section 27 of UPA declares that assignment of an interest in the partnership neither dissolves the partnership nor entitles the assignee “to interfere in the management or administration of the partnership business or affairs, or to require any information or account of partnership transactions, or to inspect the partnership books.” The assignment merely entitles the assignee to receive whatever profits the assignor would have received—this is the assignor’s transferable interest.<span class="footnote" id="mayer_1.0-fn41_015">UPA, Section 26.</span> Under UPA, this interest is assignable.<span class="footnote" id="mayer_1.0-fn41_016">UPA, Section 27.</span></p>
                <p class="para editable block" id="mayer_1.0-ch41_s01_s02_s05_s01_p02">Under RUPA, the same distinction is made between a partner’s interest in the partnership and a partner’s transferable interest. The Official Comment to Section 101 reads as follows: “‘Partnership interest’ or ‘partner’s interest in the partnership’ is defined to mean all of a partner’s interests in the partnership, including the partner’s transferable interest and all management and other rights. A partner’s ‘transferable interest’ is a more limited concept and means only his share of the profits and losses and right to receive distributions, that is, the partner’s economic interests.”<span class="footnote" id="mayer_1.0-fn41_017">RUPA, Official Comment to Section 101.</span></p>
                <p class="para editable block" id="mayer_1.0-ch41_s01_s02_s05_s01_p03">This transferable interest is assignable under RUPA 503 (unless the partners agree to restrict transfers, Section 103(a)). It does not, by itself, cause the dissolution of the partnership; it does not entitle the transferee to access to firm information, to participate in running the firm, or to inspect or copy the books. The transferee is entitled to whatever distributions the transferor partner would have been entitled to, including, upon dissolution of the firm, the net amounts the transferor would have received had there been no assignment.</p>
                <p class="para editable block" id="mayer_1.0-ch41_s01_s02_s05_s01_p04">RUPA Section 101(b)(3) confers standing on a transferee to seek a judicial dissolution and winding up of the partnership business as provided in Section 801(6), thus continuing the rule of UPA Section 32(2). But under RUPA 601(4)(ii), the other partners may by unanimous vote expel a partner who has made “a transfer of all or substantially all of that partner’s transferable interest in the partnership, other than a transfer for security purposes [as for a loan].” Upon a creditor <em class="emphasis">foreclosure</em> of the security interest, though, the partner may be expelled.</p>

                <h2 class="title editable block">Involuntary Assignment</h2>
                <p class="para editable block" id="mayer_1.0-ch41_s01_s02_s05_s02_p01">It may be a misnomer to describe an involuntary assignment as a “right”; it might better be thought of as a consequence of the right to own property. In any event, if a partner is sued in his personal capacity and a judgment is rendered against him, the question arises: may the judgment creditor seize partnership property? Section 28 of UPA and RUPA Section 504 permit a judgment creditor to obtain a <span class="margin_term"><a class="glossterm">charging order</a><span class="glossdef">A court order directing a partnership to pay a partner’s judgment creditor the distribution that the partner would normally receive.</span></span>, which charges the partner’s interest in the partnership with obligation to satisfy the judgment. The court may appoint a receiver to ensure that partnership proceeds are paid to the judgment creditor. But the creditor is not entitled to specific partnership property. The partner may always pay off the debt and redeem his interest in the partnership. If the partner does not pay off the debt, the holder of the charging order may acquire legal ownership of the partner’s interest. That confers upon the judgment creditor an important power: he may, if the partnership is one at will, dissolve the partnership and claim the partner’s share of the assets. For that reason, the copartners might wish to redeem the interest—pay off the creditor—in order to preserve the partnership. As with the voluntary assignment, the assignee of an involuntary assignment does not become a partner.

                <p class="para editable block" id="mayer_1.0-ch41_s01_s02_s06_s01_p01">We noted in <a class="xref" href="#mayer_1.0-ch41_s01_s01">Section 23.1.1 "Duties Partners Owe Each Other"</a> of this chapter that partners have a duty to account; the corollary right is the right to access books and records, which is usually very important in determining partnership rights. Section 403(b) of RUPA provides, “A partnership shall provide partners and their agents and attorneys access to its books and records. It shall provide former partners and their agents and attorneys access to books and records pertaining to the period during which they were partners. The right of access provides the opportunity to inspect and copy books and records during ordinary business hours. A partnership may impose a reasonable charge, covering the costs of labor and material, for copies of documents furnished.”<span class="footnote" id="mayer_1.0-fn41_018">RUPA Section 403(b).</span></p>
                <p class="para editable block" id="mayer_1.0-ch41_s01_s02_s06_s01_p02">Section 19 of UPA is basically in accord. This means that without demand—and for any purpose—the partnership must provide any information concerning its business and affairs reasonably required for the proper exercise of the partner’s rights and duties under the partnership agreement or the act; and on demand, it must provide any other information concerning the partnership’s business and affairs, unless the demand is unreasonable or improper.<span class="footnote" id="mayer_1.0-fn41_019">RUPA, Section 403(c)(1); RUPA, Section 403(c)(2).</span> Generally, the partnership agreement cannot deny the right to inspection.</p>
                <p class="para editable block" id="mayer_1.0-ch41_s01_s02_s06_s01_p03">The duty to account mentioned in <a class="xref" href="#mayer_1.0-ch41_s01_s01">Section 23.1.1 "Duties Partners Owe Each Other"</a> of this chapter normally means that the partners and the partnership should keep reasonable records so everyone can tell what is going on. A formal accounting under UPA is different.</p>
                <p class="para editable block" id="mayer_1.0-ch41_s01_s02_s06_s01_p04">Under UPA Section 22, any partner is entitled to a formal account (or accounting) of the partnership affairs under the following conditions:</p>
                <ol class="orderedlist editable block" id="mayer_1.0-ch41_s01_s02_s06_s01_l01">
                    <li>If he is wrongfully excluded from the partnership business or possession of its property by his copartners;</li>
                    <li>If the right exists under the terms of any agreement;</li>
                    <li>If a partner profits in violation of his fiduciary duty (as per UPA 22); and</li>
                    <li>Whenever it is otherwise just and reasonable.</li>

                <p class="para editable block" id="mayer_1.0-ch41_s01_s02_s06_s01_p05">At common law, partners could not obtain an accounting except in the event of dissolution. But from an early date, equity courts would appoint a referee, auditor, or special master to investigate the books of a business when one of the partners had grounds to complain, and UPA broadened considerably the right to an accounting. The court has plenary power to investigate all facets of the business, evaluate claims, declare legal rights among the parties, and order money judgments against any partner in the wrong.</p>
                <p class="para editable block" id="mayer_1.0-ch41_s01_s02_s06_s01_p06">Under RUPA Section 405, this “accounting” business is somewhat modified. Reflecting the entity theory, the <em class="emphasis">partnership</em> can sue a partner for wrongdoing, which is not allowed under UPA. Moreover, to quote from the Official Comment, RUPA “provides that, during the term of the partnership, partners may maintain a variety of legal or equitable actions, including an action for an accounting, as well as a final action for an accounting upon dissolution and winding up. It reflects a new policy choice that partners should have access to the courts during the term of the partnership to resolve claims against the partnership and the other partners, leaving broad judicial discretion to fashion appropriate remedies[, and] an accounting is not a prerequisite to the availability of the other remedies a partner may have against the partnership or the other partners.”<span class="footnote" id="mayer_1.0-fn41_020">RUPA Official Comment 2, Section 405(b).</span></p>
