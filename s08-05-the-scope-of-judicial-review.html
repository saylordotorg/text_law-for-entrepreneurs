    <p class="para editable block" id="mayer_1.0-ch05_s05_p01">Neither an administrative agency’s adjudication nor its issuance of a regulation is necessarily final. Most federal agency decisions are appealable to the federal circuit courts. To get to court, the appellant must overcome numerous complex hurdles. He or she must have standing—that is, be in some sense directly affected by the decision or regulation. The case must be ripe for review; administrative remedies such as further appeal within the agency must have been exhausted.</p>
    <div class="section" id="mayer_1.0-ch05_s05_s01">
        <h2 class="title editable block">Exhaustion of Administrative Remedies</h2>
        <p class="para editable block" id="mayer_1.0-ch05_s05_s01_p01">Before you can complain to court about an agency’s action, you must first try to get the agency to reconsider its action. Generally, you must have asked for a hearing at the hearing examiner level, there must have been a decision reached that was unfavorable to you, and you must have appealed the decision to the full board. The full board must rule against you, and only then will you be heard by a court. The broadest exception to this <span class="margin_term"><a class="glossterm">exhaustion of administrative remedies</a><span class="glossdef">A requirement that anyone wishing to appeal an agency action must wait until the agency has taken final action.</span></span> requirement is if the agency had no authority to issue the rule or regulation in the first place, if exhaustion of remedies would be impractical or futile, or if great harm would happen should the rule or regulation continue to apply. Also, if the agency is not acting in good faith, the courts will hear an appeal without exhaustion.</p>
    </div>
    <div class="section" id="mayer_1.0-ch05_s05_s02">
        <h2 class="title editable block">Strategies for Obtaining Judicial Review</h2>
        <p class="para editable block" id="mayer_1.0-ch05_s05_s02_p01">Once these obstacles are cleared, the court may look at one of a series of claims. The appellant might assert that the agency’s action was ultra vires (UL-truh VI-reez)—beyond the scope of its authority as set down in the statute. This attack is rarely successful. A somewhat more successful claim is that the agency did not abide by its own procedures or those imposed upon it by the Administrative Procedure Act.</p>
        <p class="para editable block" id="mayer_1.0-ch05_s05_s02_p02">In formal rulemaking, the appellant also might insist that the agency lacked substantial evidence for the determination that it made. If there is virtually no evidence to support the agency’s findings, the court may reverse. But findings of fact are not often overturned by the courts.</p>
        <p class="para editable block" id="mayer_1.0-ch05_s05_s02_p03">Likewise, there has long been a presumption that when an agency issues a regulation, it has the authority to do so: those opposing the regulation must bear a heavy burden in court to upset it. This is not a surprising rule, for otherwise courts, not administrators, would be the authors of regulations. Nevertheless, regulations cannot exceed the scope of the authority conferred by Congress on the agency. In an important 1981 case before the Supreme Court, the issue was whether the secretary of labor, acting through the Occupational Health and Safety Administration (OSHA), could lawfully issue a standard limiting exposure to cotton dust in the workplace without first undertaking a cost-benefit analysis. A dozen cotton textile manufacturers and the American Textile Manufacturers Institute, representing 175 companies, asserted that the cotton dust standard was unlawful because it did not rationally relate the benefits to be derived from the standard to the costs that the standard would impose. See <a class="xref" href="mayer_1.0-ch05_s06#mayer_1.0-ch05_s06">Section 5.6 "Cases"</a>, <em class="emphasis">American Textile Manufacturers Institute v. Donovan</em>.</p>
        <p class="para editable block" id="mayer_1.0-ch05_s05_s02_p04">In summary, then, an individual or a company may (after exhaustion of administrative remedies) challenge agency action where such action is the following:</p>
        <ul class="itemizedlist editable block" id="mayer_1.0-ch05_s05_s02_l01">
            <li>not in accordance with the agency’s scope of authority</li>
            <li>not in accordance with the US Constitution or the Administrative Procedure Act</li>
            <li>not in accordance with the substantial evidence test</li>
            <li>unwarranted by the facts</li>
            <li>arbitrary, capricious, an abuse of discretion, or otherwise not in accord with the law</li>
        </ul>
        <p class="para editable block" id="mayer_1.0-ch05_s05_s02_p05">Section 706 of the Administrative Procedure Act sets out those standards. While it is difficult to show that an agency’s action is arbitrary and capricious, there are cases that have so held. For example, after the Reagan administration set aside a Carter administration rule from the National Highway Traffic and Safety Administration on passive restraints in automobiles, State Farm and other insurance companies challenged the reversal as arbitrary and capricious. Examining the record, the Supreme Court found that the agency had failed to state enough reasons for its reversal and required the agency to review the record and the rule and provide adequate reasons for its reversal. State Farm and other insurance companies thus gained a legal benefit by keeping an agency rule that placed costs on automakers for increased passenger safety and potentially reducing the number of injury claims from those it had insured.<span class="footnote" id="mayer_1.0-fn05_006"><em class="emphasis">Motor Vehicle Manufacturers’ Assn. v. State Farm Mutual Ins.</em>, 463 US 29 (1983).</span></p>

        <h2 class="title editable block">Suing the Government</h2>
        <p class="para editable block" id="mayer_1.0-ch05_s05_s03_p01">In the modern administrative state, the range of government activity is immense, and administrative agencies frequently get in the way of business enterprise. Often, bureaucratic involvement is wholly legitimate, compelled by law; sometimes, however, agencies or government officials may overstep their bounds, in a fit of zeal or spite. What recourse does the private individual or company have?</p>
        <p class="para editable block" id="mayer_1.0-ch05_s05_s03_p02">Mainly for historical reasons, it has always been more difficult to sue the government than to sue private individuals or corporations. For one thing, the government has long had recourse to the doctrine of sovereign immunity as a shield against lawsuits. Yet in 1976, Congress amended the Administrative Procedure Act to waive any federal claim to sovereign immunity in cases of injunctive or other nonmonetary relief. Earlier, in 1946, in the Federal Tort Claims Act, Congress had waived sovereign immunity of the federal government for most tort claims for money damages, although the act contains several exceptions for specific agencies (e.g., one cannot sue for injuries resulting from fiscal operations of the Treasury Department or for injuries stemming from activities of the military in wartime). The act also contains a major exception for claims “based upon [an official’s] exercise or performance or the failure to exercise or perform a discretionary function or duty.” This exception prevents suits against parole boards for paroling dangerous criminals who then kill or maim in the course of another crime and suits against officials whose decision to ship explosive materials by public carrier leads to mass deaths and injuries following an explosion en route.<span class="footnote" id="mayer-5624-20111224-173052-448260"><em class="emphasis">Dalehite v. United States</em>, 346 US 15 (1953).</span></p>
        <p class="para editable block" id="mayer_1.0-ch05_s05_s03_p03">In recent years, the Supreme Court has been stripping away the traditional immunity enjoyed by many government officials against personal suits. Some government employees—judges, prosecutors, legislators, and the president, for example—have absolute immunity against suit for official actions. But many public administrators and government employees have at best a qualified immunity. Under a provision of the Civil Rights Act of 1871 (so-called Section 1983 actions), <em class="emphasis">state</em> officials can be sued in federal court for money damages whenever “under color of any state law” they deprive anyone of his rights under the Constitution or federal law. In <em class="emphasis">Bivens v. Six Unknown Federal Narcotics Agents</em>, the Supreme Court held that <em class="emphasis">federal</em> agents may be sued for violating the plaintiff’s Fourth Amendment rights against an unlawful search of his home.<span class="footnote" id="mayer_1.0-fn05_008"><em class="emphasis">Bivens v. Six Unknown Federal Narcotics Agents</em>, 403 US 388 (1971).</span> Subsequent cases have followed this logic to permit suits for violations of other constitutional provisions. This area of the law is in a state of flux, and it is likely to continue to evolve.</p>
        <p class="para editable block" id="mayer_1.0-ch05_s05_s03_p04">Sometimes damage is done to an individual or business because the government has given out erroneous information. For example, suppose that Charles, a bewildered, disabled navy employee, is receiving a federal disability annuity. Under the regulations, he would lose his pension if he took a job that paid him in each of two succeeding years more than 80 percent of what he earned in his old navy job. A few years later, Congress changed the law, making him ineligible if he earned more than 80 percent in anyone year. For many years, Charles earned considerably less than the ceiling amount. But then one year he got the opportunity to make some extra money. Not wishing to lose his pension, he called an employee relations specialist in the US Navy and asked how much he could earn and still keep his pension. The specialist gave him erroneous information over the telephone and then sent him an out-of-date form that said Charles could safely take on the extra work. Unfortunately, as it turned out, Charles did exceed the salary limit, and so the government cut off his pension during the time he earned too much. Charles sues to recover his lost pension. He argues that he relied to his detriment on false information supplied by the navy and that in fairness the government should be estopped from denying his claim.</p>
        <p class="para editable block" id="mayer_1.0-ch05_s05_s03_p05">Unfortunately for Charles, he will lose his case. In <em class="emphasis">Office of Personnel Management v. Richmond</em>, the Supreme Court reasoned that it would be unconstitutional to permit recovery.<span class="footnote" id="mayer_1.0-fn05_009"><em class="emphasis">Office of Personnel Management v. Richmond</em>, 110 S. Ct. 2465 (1990).</span> The appropriations clause of Article I says that federal money can be paid out only through an appropriation made by law. The law prevented this particular payment to be made. If the court were to make an exception, it would permit executive officials in effect to make binding payments, even though unauthorized, simply by misrepresenting the facts. The harsh reality, therefore, is that mistakes of the government are generally held against the individual, not the government, unless the law specifically provides for recompense (as, for example, in the Federal Tort Claims Act just discussed).</p>

            <p class="para" id="mayer_1.0-ch05_s05_s03_p06">After exhausting administrative remedies, there are numerous grounds for seeking judicial review of an agency’s order or of a final rule. While courts defer to agencies to some degree, an agency must follow its own rules, comply with the Administrative Procedure Act, act within the scope of its delegated authority, avoid acting in an arbitrary manner, and make final rules that are supported by substantial evidence.</p>
