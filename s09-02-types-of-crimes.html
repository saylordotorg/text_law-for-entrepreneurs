    <p class="para editable block" id="mayer_1.0-ch06_s02_p01">Most classifications of crime turn on the seriousness of the act. In general, seriousness is defined by the nature or duration of the punishment set out in the statute. A <span class="margin_term"><a class="glossterm">felony</a><span class="glossdef">A serious kind of crime, usually involving potential imprisonment of six months or more.</span></span> is a crime punishable (usually) by imprisonment of more than one year or by death. (Crimes punishable by death are sometimes known as capital crimes; they are increasingly rare in the United States.) The major felonies include murder, rape, kidnapping, armed robbery, embezzlement, insider trading, fraud, and racketeering. All other crimes are usually known as <span class="margin_term"><a class="glossterm">misdemeanors</a><span class="glossdef">Crimes that are less serious than a felony, usually involving punishment of six months in prison or less.</span></span>, petty offenses, or infractions. Another way of viewing crimes is by the type of social harm the statute is intended to prevent or deter, such as offenses against the person, offenses against property, and white-collar crime.</p>

            <h2 class="title editable block">Homicide</h2>
            <p class="para editable block" id="mayer_1.0-ch06_s02_s01_s01_p01"><span class="margin_term"><a class="glossterm">Homicide</a><span class="glossdef">The killing of one person by another without legal excuse.</span></span> is the killing of one person by another. Not every killing is criminal. When the law permits one person to kill another—for example, a soldier killing an enemy on the battlefield during war, or a killing in self-defense—the death is considered the result of <span class="margin_term"><a class="glossterm">justifiable homicide</a><span class="glossdef">When the law permits one person to kill another.</span></span>. An <em class="emphasis">excusable homicide</em>, by contrast, is one in which death results from an accident in which the killer is not at fault.</p>
            <p class="para editable block" id="mayer_1.0-ch06_s02_s01_s01_p02">All other homicides are criminal. The most severely punished form is murder, defined as homicide committed with “malice aforethought.” This is a term with a very long history. Boiled down to its essentials, it means that the defendant had the intent to kill. A killing need not be premeditated for any long period of time; the premeditation might be quite sudden, as in a bar fight that escalates in that moment when one of the fighters reaches for a knife with the intent to kill.</p>
            <p class="para editable block" id="mayer_1.0-ch06_s02_s01_s01_p03">Sometimes a homicide can be murder even if there is no intent to kill; an intent to inflict great bodily harm can be murder if the result is the death of another person. A killing that takes place while a felony (such as armed robbery) is being committed is also murder, whether or not the killer intended any harm. This is the so-called felony murder rule. Examples are the accidental discharge of a gun that kills an innocent bystander or the asphyxiation death of a fireman from smoke resulting from a fire set by an arsonist. The felony murder rule is more significant than it sounds, because it also applies to the accomplices of one who does the killing. Thus the driver of a getaway car stationed a block away from the scene of the robbery can be convicted of murder if a gun accidentally fires during the robbery and someone is killed. Manslaughter is an act of killing that does not amount to murder. Voluntary manslaughter is an intentional killing, but one carried out in the “sudden heat of passion” as the result of some provocation. An example is a fight that gets out of hand. Involuntary manslaughter entails a lesser degree of willfulness; it usually occurs when someone has taken a reckless action that results in death (e.g., a death resulting from a traffic accident in which one driver recklessly runs a red light).</p>

            <h2 class="title editable block">Assault and Battery</h2>
            <p class="para editable block" id="mayer_1.0-ch06_s02_s01_s02_p01">Ordinarily, we would say that a person who has struck another has “assaulted” him. Technically, that is a <span class="margin_term"><a class="glossterm">battery</a><span class="glossdef">The unlawful application of force to another person. The force need not be violent.</span></span>—the unlawful application of force to another person. The force need not be violent. Indeed, a man who kisses a woman is guilty of a battery if he does it against her will. The other person may consent to the force. That is one reason why surgeons require patients to sign consent forms, giving the doctor permission to operate. In the absence of such a consent, an operation is a battery. That is also why football players are not constantly being charged with battery. Those who agree to play football agree to submit to the rules of the game, which of course include the right to tackle. But the consent does not apply to all acts of physical force: a hockey player who hits an opponent over the head with his stick can be prosecuted for the crime of battery.</p>
            <p class="para editable block" id="mayer_1.0-ch06_s02_s01_s02_p02">Criminal <span class="margin_term"><a class="glossterm">assault</a><span class="glossdef">An attempt to commit a battery, or the deliberate placing of another in fear of receiving an immediate battery.</span></span> is an <em class="emphasis">attempt</em> to commit a battery or the deliberate placing of another in fear of receiving an immediate battery. If you throw a rock at a friend, but he manages to dodge it, you have committed an assault. Some states limit an assault to an attempt to commit a battery by one who has a “present ability” to do so. Pointing an unloaded gun and threatening to shoot would not be an assault, nor, of course, could it be a battery. The modem tendency, however, is to define an assault as an attempt to commit a battery by one with an <em class="emphasis">apparent</em> ability to do so.</p>
            <p class="para editable block" id="mayer_1.0-ch06_s02_s01_s02_p03">Assault and battery may be excused. For example, a bar owner (or her agent, the bouncer) may use reasonable force to remove an unruly patron. If the use of force is excessive, the bouncer can be found guilty of assault and battery, and a civil action could arise against the bar owner as well.</p>

            <h2 class="title editable block">Theft: Larceny, Robbery, Embezzlement, False Pretenses</h2>
            <p class="para editable block" id="mayer_1.0-ch06_s02_s02_s01_p01">The concept of theft is familiar enough. Less familiar is the way the law has treated various aspects of the act of stealing. Criminal law distinguishes among many different crimes that are popularly known as theft. Many technical words have entered the language—burglary, larceny, robbery—but are often used inaccurately. Brief definitions of the more common terms are discussed here.</p>
            <p class="para editable block" id="mayer_1.0-ch06_s02_s02_s01_p02">The basic crime of stealing personal property is <span class="margin_term"><a class="glossterm">larceny</a><span class="glossdef">The wrongful taking and carrying away of the personal property of another with intent to steal the same.</span></span>. By its old common-law definition, still in use today, larceny is the wrongful “taking and carrying away of the personal property of another with intent to steal the same.”</p>
            <p class="para editable block" id="mayer_1.0-ch06_s02_s02_s01_p03">The separate elements of this offense have given rise to all kinds of difficult cases. Take the theft of fruit, for example, with regard to the essential element of “personal property.” If a man walking through an orchard plucks a peach from a tree and eats it, he is not guilty of larceny because he has not taken away <em class="emphasis">personal</em> property (the peach is part of the land, being connected to the tree). But if he picks up a peach lying on the ground, he is guilty of larceny. Or consider the element of “taking” or “carrying away.” Sneaking into a movie theater without paying is not an act of larceny (though in most states it is a criminal act). Taking electricity by tapping into the power lines of an electric utility was something that baffled judges late in the nineteenth century because it was not clear whether electricity is a “something” that can be taken. Modern statutes have tended to make clear that electricity can be the object of larceny. Or consider the element of an “intent to steal the same.” If you borrow your friend’s BMW without his permission in order to go to the grocery store, intending to return it within a few minutes and then do return it, you have not committed larceny. But if you meet another friend at the store who convinces you to take a long joyride with the car and you return hours later, you may have committed larceny.</p>
            <p class="para editable block" id="mayer_1.0-ch06_s02_s02_s01_p04">A particular form of larceny is <span class="margin_term"><a class="glossterm">robbery</a><span class="glossdef">Larceny from a person by means of violence or intimidation.</span></span>, which is defined as larceny from a person by means of violence or intimidation.</p>
            <p class="para editable block" id="mayer_1.0-ch06_s02_s02_s01_p05">Larceny involves the taking of property from the possession of another. Suppose that a person legitimately comes to possess the property of another and wrongfully appropriates it—for example, an automobile mechanic entrusted with your car refuses to return it, or a bank teller who is entitled to temporary possession of cash in his drawer takes it home with him. The common law had trouble with such cases because the thief in these cases already had possession; his crime was in assuming ownership. Today, such wrongful conversion, known as <span class="margin_term"><a class="glossterm">embezzlement</a><span class="glossdef">A form of larceny in which a person entrusted with someone else’s property wrongfully takes sole possession or has the intent to take sole possession.</span></span>, has been made a statutory offense in all states.</p>
            <p class="para editable block" id="mayer_1.0-ch06_s02_s02_s01_p06">Statutes against larceny and embezzlement did not cover all the gaps in the law. A conceptual problem arises in the case of one who is tricked into giving up his title to property. In larceny and embezzlement, the thief gains possession or ownership without any consent of the owner or custodian of the property. Suppose, however, that an automobile dealer agrees to take his customer’s present car as a trade-in. The customer says that he has full title to the car. In fact, the customer is still paying off an installment loan and the finance company has an interest in the old car. If the finance company repossesses the car, the customer—who got a new car at a discount because of his false representation—cannot be said to have taken the new car by larceny or embezzlement. Nevertheless, he tricked the dealer into selling, and the dealer will have lost the value of the repossessed car. Obviously, the customer is guilty of a criminal act; the statutes outlawing it refer to this trickery as the crime of <span class="margin_term"><a class="glossterm">false pretenses</a><span class="glossdef">A form of larceny in which the rightful owner is tricked into giving up title to his or her property.</span></span>, defined as obtaining ownership of the property of another by making untrue representations of fact with intent to defraud.</p>
            <p class="para editable block" id="mayer_1.0-ch06_s02_s02_s01_p07">A number of problems have arisen in the judicial interpretation of false-pretense statutes. One concerns whether the taking is permanent or only temporary. The case of <em class="emphasis">State v. Mills</em> (<a class="xref" href="mayer_1.0-ch06_s07#mayer_1.0-ch06_s07">Section 6.7 "Cases"</a>) shows the subtle questions that can be presented and the dangers inherent in committing “a little fraud.”</p>
            <p class="para editable block" id="mayer_1.0-ch06_s02_s02_s01_p08">In the <em class="emphasis">Mills</em> case, the claim was that a mortgage instrument dealing with one parcel of land was used instead for another. This is a false representation of fact. Suppose, by contrast, that a person misrepresents his state of mind: “I will pay you back tomorrow,” he says, knowing full well that he does not intend to. Can such a misrepresentation amount to false pretenses punishable as a criminal offense? In most jurisdictions it cannot. A false-pretense violation relates to a past event or existing fact, not to a statement of intention. If it were otherwise, anyone failing to pay a debt might find himself facing criminal prosecution, and business would be less prone to take risks.</p>
            <p class="para editable block" id="mayer_1.0-ch06_s02_s02_s01_p09">The problem of proving intent is especially difficult when a person has availed himself of the services of another without paying. A common example is someone leaving a restaurant without paying for the meal. In most states, this is specifically defined in the statutes as <em class="emphasis">theft of services</em>.</p>

            <p class="para editable block" id="mayer_1.0-ch06_s02_s02_s02_p01">One who engages in <span class="margin_term"><a class="glossterm">receiving stolen property</a><span class="glossdef">Depending on the value of the property, if you receive property from another person, knowing that it has been stolen, you have committed either a misdemeanor or a felony.</span></span> with knowledge that it is stolen is guilty of a felony or misdemeanor, depending on the value of the property. The receipt need not be personal; if the property is delivered to a place under the control of the receiver, then he is deemed to have received it. “Knowledge” is construed broadly: not merely actual knowledge, but (correct) belief and suspicion (strong enough not to investigate for fear that the property will turn out to have been stolen) are sufficient for conviction.</p>

            <h2 class="title editable block">Forgery</h2>
            <p class="para editable block" id="mayer_1.0-ch06_s02_s02_s03_p01"><span class="margin_term"><a class="glossterm">Forgery</a><span class="glossdef">False writing of a document of legal significance (or apparent legal significance) with intent to defraud.</span></span> is false writing of a document of legal significance (or apparent legal significance!) with intent to defraud. It includes the making up of a false document or the alteration of an existing one. The writing need not be done by hand but can be by any means—typing, printing, and so forth. Documents commonly the subject of forgery are negotiable instruments (checks, money orders, and the like), deeds, receipts, contracts, and bills of lading. The forged instrument must itself be false, not merely contain a falsehood. If you fake your neighbor’s signature on one of his checks made out to cash, you have committed forgery. But if you sign a check of your own that is made out to cash, knowing that there is no money in your checking account, the instrument is not forged, though the act may be criminal if done with the intent to defraud.</p>
            <p class="para editable block" id="mayer_1.0-ch06_s02_s02_s03_p02">The mere making of a forged instrument is unlawful. So is the “uttering” (or presentation) of such an instrument, whether or not the one uttering it actually forged it. The usual example of a false signature is by no means the only way to commit forgery. If done with intent to defraud, the backdating of a document, the modification of a corporate name, or the filling in of lines left blank on a form can all constitute forgery.</p>

            <p class="para editable block" id="mayer_1.0-ch06_s02_s02_s04_p01">Under common law, <span class="margin_term"><a class="glossterm">extortion</a><span class="glossdef">The wrongful collection of money or something else of value by anyone by means of a threat.</span></span> could only be committed by a government official, who corruptly collected an unlawful fee under color of office. A common example is a salaried building inspector who refuses to issue a permit unless the permittee pays him. Under modern statutes, the crime of extortion has been broadened to include the wrongful collection of money or something else of value by anyone by means of a threat (short of a threat of immediate physical violence, for such a threat would make the demand an act of robbery). This kind of extortion is usually called blackmail. The blackmail threat commonly is to expose some fact of the victim’s private life or to make a false accusation about him.</p>

It is defined as “the breaking and entering of the dwelling of another in the nighttime with intent to commit a felony.” The intent to steal is not an issue: a man who sneaks into a woman’s home intent on raping her has committed a burglary, even if he does not carry out the act. The student doing critical thinking will no doubt notice that the definition provides plenty of room for argument. What is “breaking”? (The courts do not require actual destruction; the mere opening of a closed door, even if unlocked, is enough.) What is entry? When does night begin? What kind of intent? Whose dwelling?

Armed bank robbery is not a white-collar crime, but embezzlement by a teller or bank officer is. Many white-collar crimes are included within the statutory definitions of embezzlement and false pretenses. Most are violations of state law.

The law also bans attempts to defraud, so the prosecutor need not show that the scheme worked or that anyone suffered any losses. “Fraud” is broadly construed: anyone who uses the mails or telephone to defraud anyone else of virtually anything, not just of money, can be convicted under the law. In one case, a state governor was convicted of mail fraud when he took bribes to influence the setting of racing dates.

            <p class="para editable block" id="mayer_1.0-ch06_s02_s04_s04_p01">Many federal environmental statutes have criminal provisions. These include the Federal Water Pollution Control Act (commonly called the Clean Water Act); the Rivers and Harbors Act of 1899 (the Refuse Act); the Clean Air Act; the Federal Insecticide, Fungicide, and Rodenticide Act (FIFRA); the Toxic Substances Control Act (TSCA); and the Resource Conservation and Recovery Act (RCRA). Under the Clean Water Act, for example, wrongful discharge of pollutants into navigable waters carries a fine ranging from $2,500 to $25,000 per day and imprisonment for up to one year. “Responsible corporate officers” are specifically included as potential defendants in criminal prosecutions under the act. They can include officers who have responsibility over a project where subcontractors and their employees actually caused the discharge.<span class="footnote" id="mayer_1.0-fn06_002"><em class="emphasis">U.S. v. Hanousek</em>, 176 F.3d 1116 (9th Cir. 1999).</span></p>

            <p class="para editable block" id="mayer_1.0-ch06_s02_s04_s05_p01">As a byproduct of Watergate, federal officials at the Securities and Exchange Commission and the Internal Revenue Service uncovered many instances of bribes paid by major corporations to officials of foreign governments to win contracts with those governments. Congress responded in 1977 with the Foreign Corrupt Practices Act, which imposed a stringent requirement that the disposition of assets be accurately and fairly accounted for in a company’s books and records. The act also made illegal the payment of bribes to foreign officials or to anyone who will transmit the money to a foreign official to assist the payor (the one offering and delivering the money) in getting business.</p>

            <p class="para editable block" id="mayer_1.0-ch06_s02_s04_s06_p01">In 1970 Congress enacted the Racketeering Influenced and Corrupt Organizations Act (RICO), aimed at ending organized crime’s infiltration into legitimate business. The act tells courts to construe its language broadly “to effectuate its remedial purpose,” and many who are not part of organized crime have been successfully prosecuted under the act. It bans a “pattern of racketeering,” defined as the commission of at least two acts within ten years of any of a variety of already-existing crimes, including mail, wire, and securities fraud. The act thus makes many types of fraud subject to severe penalties.</p>

The main federal statutory framework for many computer crimes is the Computer Fraud and Abuse Act (CFAA; see <a class="xref" href="#mayer_1.0-ch06_s02_s04_s07_t01">Table 6.1 "Summary of Provisions of the Computer Fraud and Abuse Act"</a>).
