    <p class="para editable block" id="mayer_1.0-ch43_s02_p01">Let us assume that three people have already formed a partnership to run a bookstore business. Bob has contributed $80,000. Carol has contributed a house in which the business can lawfully operate. Ted has contributed his services; he has been managing the bookstore, and the business is showing a slight profit. A friend has been telling them that they ought to incorporate. What are the major factors they should consider in reaching a decision?</p>

        <h2 class="title editable block">Ease of Formation</h2>
        <p class="para editable block" id="mayer_1.0-ch43_s02_s01_p01">Partnerships are easy to form. If the business is simple enough and the partners are few, the agreement need not even be written down. Creating a corporation is more complicated because formal documents must be placed on file with public authorities.</p>
    </div>
    <div class="section" id="mayer_1.0-ch43_s02_s02">
        <h2 class="title editable block">Ownership and Control</h2>
        <p class="para editable block" id="mayer_1.0-ch43_s02_s02_p01">All general partners have equal rights in the management and conduct of the business. By contrast, ownership and control of corporations are, in theory, separated. In the <span class="margin_term"><a class="glossterm">publicly held corporation</a><span class="glossdef">A firm that is traded publicly through the sale of stock subscriptions, has many shareholders and widely dispersed ownership, and in which shareholders have little control.</span></span>, which has many shareholders, the separation is real. Ownership is widely dispersed because millions of shares are outstanding and it is rare that any single shareholder will own more than a tiny percentage of stock. It is difficult under the best of circumstances for shareholders to exert any form of control over corporate operations. However, in the <span class="margin_term"><a class="glossterm">closely held corporation</a><span class="glossdef">A corporation with few shareholders, so that separation of ownership and control may be less pronounced than in a publicly held corporation or even nonexistent.</span></span>, which has few shareholders, the officers or senior managers are usually also the shareholders, so the separation of ownership and control may be less pronounced or even nonexistent.</p>

    <div class="section" id="mayer_1.0-ch43_s02_s03">
        <h2 class="title editable block">Transferability of Interests</h2>
        <p class="para editable block" id="mayer_1.0-ch43_s02_s03_p01">Transferability of an interest in a partnership is a problem because a transferee cannot become a member unless all partners consent. The problem can be addressed and overcome in the partnership agreement. <span class="margin_term"><a class="glossterm">Transfer of interest</a><span class="glossdef">Transferring an ownership interest through the sale of stock from one person to the next.</span></span> in a corporation, through a sale of stock, is much easier; but for the stock of a small corporation, there might not be a market or there might be contractual restrictions on transfer.</p>

    <div class="section" id="mayer_1.0-ch43_s02_s04">
        <h2 class="title editable block">Financing</h2>
        <p class="para editable block" id="mayer_1.0-ch43_s02_s04_p01">Partners have considerable flexibility in financing. They can lure potential investors by offering interests in profits and, in the case of general partnerships, control. Corporations can finance by selling freely transferable stock to the public or by incurring debt. Different approaches to the financing of corporations are discussed in <a class="xref" href="mayer_1.0-ch44#mayer_1.0-ch44">Chapter 26 "Legal Aspects of Corporate Finance"</a>.</p>
    </div>
    <div class="section" id="mayer_1.0-ch43_s02_s05">
        <h2 class="title editable block">Taxation</h2>
        <p class="para editable block" id="mayer_1.0-ch43_s02_s05_p01">The partnership is a conduit for income and is not taxed as a separate entity. Individual partners are taxed, and although limited by the 1986 Tax Reform Act, they can deduct partnership losses. Corporate earnings, on the other hand, are subject to double taxation. The corporation is first taxed on its own earnings as an entity. Then, when profits are distributed to shareholders in the form of dividends, the shareholders are taxed again. (A small corporation, with no more than one hundred shareholders, can elect S corporation status. Because S corporations are taxed as partnerships, they avoid double taxation.) However, incorporating brings several tax benefits. For example, the corporation can take deductions for life, medical, and disability insurance coverage for its employees, whereas partners or sole proprietors cannot.</p>

            <h3 class="title">Key Takeaway</h3>
            <p class="para" id="mayer_1.0-ch43_s02_s05_p02">Partnerships are easier to form than corporations, especially since no documents are required. General partners share both ownership and control, but in publicly held corporations, these functions are separated. Additional benefits for a partnership include flexibility in financing, single taxation, and the ability to deduct losses. Transfer of interest in a partnership can be difficult if not addressed in the initial agreement, since all partners must consent to the transfer.</p>
