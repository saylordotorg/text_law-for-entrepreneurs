        <h2 class="title editable block">Changes in the Revised Model Business Corporation Act</h2>
        <p class="para editable block" id="mayer_1.0-ch44_s06_s01_p01">Perhaps the most dramatic innovations incorporated into the Revised Model Business Corporation Act (RMBCA) are the financial provisions. The revisions recommend eliminating concepts such as par value stock, no-par stock, stated capital, capital surplus, earned surplus, and treasury shares. It was felt that these concepts—notably par value and stated capital—no longer serve their original purpose of protecting creditors.</p>
        <p class="para editable block" id="mayer_1.0-ch44_s06_s01_p02">A key definition under the revisions is that of <em class="emphasis">distributions</em>—that is, any transfer of money or property to the shareholders. In order to make distributions, a corporation must meet the traditional insolvency test and balance sheet tests. Under the balance sheet test, corporate assets must be greater than or equal to liabilities and liquidation preferences on senior equity. The RMBCA also provides that promissory notes and contracts for future services may be used in payment for shares.</p>
        <p class="para editable block" id="mayer_1.0-ch44_s06_s01_p03">It is important to note that the RMBCA is advisory. Not every state has abandoned <em class="emphasis">par value</em> or the other financial terms. For example, Delaware is quite liberal with its requirements:</p>
        <span class="blockquote block" id="mayer_1.0-ch44_s06_s01_bl01">
            <p class="para editable" id="mayer_1.0-ch44_s06_s01_p04">Every corporation may issue 1 or more classes of stock or 1 or more series of stock within any class thereof, any or all of which classes may be of stock with par value or stock without par value and which classes or series may have such voting powers, full or limited, or no voting powers, and such designations, preferences and relative, participating, optional or other special rights, and qualifications, limitations or restrictions thereof, as shall be stated and expressed in the certificate of incorporation or of any amendment thereto, or in the resolution or resolutions providing for the issue of such stock adopted by the board of directors pursuant to authority expressly vested in it by the provisions of its certificate of incorporation.<span class="footnote" id="mayer_1.0-fn44_006">Del. Code Ann. tit. 8, § 151 (2011).</span></p>
        </span>
        <p class="para editable block" id="mayer_1.0-ch44_s06_s01_p05">Therefore, although the modern trend is to move away from <em class="emphasis">par value</em> as well as some other previously discussed terms—<em class="emphasis">and despite the RMBCA’s abandonment of these concepts</em>—they still, in large measure, persist.</p>

        <h2 class="title editable block">Introduction to Article 8 of the Uniform Commercial Code</h2>
        <p class="para editable block" id="mayer_1.0-ch44_s06_s02_p01">Partial ownership of a corporation would be an awkward investment if there were no ready means of transfer. The availability of paper certificates as tangible evidence of the ownership of equity securities solves the problem of what to transfer, but since a corporation must maintain records of its owners, a set of rules is necessary to spell out how transfers are to be made. That set of rules is Article 8 of the Uniform Commercial Code (UCC). Article 8 governs certificated securities, uncertificated securities, registration requirements, transfer, purchase, and other specifics of securities. Article 8 can be viewed at <a class="link" target="_blank" href="http://www.law.cornell.edu/ucc/8/overview.html">http://www.law.cornell.edu/ucc/8/overview.html</a>.</p>

        <h2 class="title editable block">The UCC and the 1933 and 1934 Securities Acts</h2>
        <p class="para editable block" id="mayer_1.0-ch44_s06_s03_p01">The Securities Act of 1933 requires the registration of securities that are sold or offered to be sold using interstate commerce. The Securities Exchange Act of 1934 governs the secondary trading of securities, such as stock market sales. The UCC also governs securities, through Articles 8 and 9. The key difference is that the 1933 and 1934 acts are federal law, while the UCC operates at the state level. The UCC was established to standardize state laws governing sales and commercial transactions. There are some substantial differences, however, between the two acts and the UCC. Without going into exhaustive detail, it is important to note a few of them. For one, the definition of <em class="emphasis">security</em> in the UCC is different from the definition in the 1933 and 1934 acts. Thus a security may be governed by the securities acts but not by the UCC. The definition of a private placement of securities also differs between the UCC and the securities acts. Other differences exist.<span class="footnote" id="mayer_1.0-fn44_007">See Lynn Soukup, “Securities Law and the UCC: When Godzilla Meets Bambi,” <em class="emphasis">Uniform Commercial Code Law Journal</em> 38, no. 1 (Summer 2005): 3–28.</span> The UCC, as well as state-specific laws, and the federal securities laws should all be considered in financial transactions.</p>

            <h3 class="title">Key Takeaway</h3>
            <p class="para" id="mayer_1.0-ch44_s06_s03_p02">The RMBCA advises doing away with financial concepts such as stock par value. Despite this suggestion, these concepts persist. Corporate finance is regulated through a variety of mechanisms, most notably Articles 8 and 9 of the Uniform Commercial Code and the 1933 and 1934 securities acts.</p>
