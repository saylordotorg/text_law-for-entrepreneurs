        <p class="para editable block" id="mayer_1.0-ch40_s01_s01_p03">Partnerships are also popular as investment vehicles. Partnership law and tax law permit an investor to put capital into a limited partnership and realize tax benefits without liability for the acts of the general partners.</p>
        <p class="para editable block" id="mayer_1.0-ch40_s01_s01_p04">Even if you do not plan to work within a partnership, it can be important to understand the law that governs it. Why? Because it is possible to become someone’s partner without intending to or even realizing that a partnership has been created. Knowledge of the law can help you avoid partnership liability.</p>

            <h2 class="title editable block">Through the Twentieth Century</h2>
            <p class="para editable block" id="mayer_1.0-ch40_s01_s02_s01_p01">Partnership is an ancient form of business enterprise, and special laws governing partnerships date as far back as 2300 BC, when the Code of Hammurabi explicitly regulated the relations between partners. Partnership was an important part of Roman law, and it played a significant role in the law merchant, the international commercial law of the Middle Ages.</p>
            <p class="para editable block" id="mayer_1.0-ch40_s01_s02_s01_p02">In the nineteenth century, in both England and the United States, partnership was a popular vehicle for business enterprise. But the law governing it was jumbled. Common-law principles were mixed with equitable standards, and the result was considerable confusion. Parliament moved to reduce the uncertainty by adopting the Partnership Act of 1890, but codification took longer in the United States. The Commissioners on Uniform State Laws undertook the task at the turn of the twentieth century. The Uniform Partnership Act (UPA), completed in 1914, and the Uniform Limited Partnership Act (ULPA), completed in 1916, were the basis of partnership law for many decades. UPA and ULPA were adopted by all states except Louisiana.</p>

            <p class="para editable block" id="mayer_1.0-ch40_s01_s02_s02_p01">Despite its name, UPA was not enacted uniformly among the states; moreover, it had some shortcomings. So the states tinkered with it, and by the 1980s, the National Conference of Commissioners on Uniform Laws (NCCUL) determined that a revised version was in order. An amended UPA appeared in 1992, and further amendments were promulgated in 1993, 1994, 1996, and 1997. The NCCUL reports that thirty-nine states have adopted some version of the revised act. This chapter will discuss the Revised Uniform Partnership Act (RUPA) as promulgated in 1997, but because not all jurisdictions have not adopted it, where RUPA makes significant changes, the original 1914 UPA will also be considered.<span class="footnote" id="mayer_1.0-fn40_002">NCCUSL, Uniform Law Commission, “Acts: Partnership Act,” <a class="link" target="_blank" href="http://www.nccusl.org/Act.aspx?title=Partnership%20Act">http://www.nccusl.org/Act.aspx?title=Partnership%20Act</a>. The following states <em class="emphasis">have</em> adopted the RUPA: Alabama, Alaska, Arizona, Arkansas, California, Colorado, Delaware, District of Columbia, Florida, Hawaii, Idaho, Illinois, Iowa, Kansas, Kentucky, Maine, Maryland, Minnesota, Mississippi, Montana, Nebraska, Nevada, New Jersey, New Mexico, North Dakota, Oklahoma, Oregon, Puerto Rico, South Dakota (substantially similar), Tennessee, Texas (substantially similar), US Virgin Islands, Vermont, Virginia, and Washington. Connecticut, West Virginia, and Wyoming adopted the 1992 or 1994 version. Here are the states that have <em class="emphasis">not</em> adopted RUPA (Louisiana never adopted UPA at all): Georgia, Indiana, Massachusetts, Michigan, Mississippi, New Hampshire, New York, North Carolina, Ohio, Pennsylvania, Rhode Island, and Wisconsin.</span> The NCCUL observes in its “prefatory note” to the 1997 act: “The Revised Act is largely a series of ‘default rules’ that govern the relations among partners in situations they have not addressed in a partnership agreement. The primary focus of RUPA is the small, often informal, partnership. Larger partnerships generally have a partnership agreement addressing, and often modifying, many of the provisions of the partnership act.”<span class="footnote" id="mayer_1.0-fn40_003">University of Pennsylvania Law School, Biddle Law Library, “Uniform Partnership Act (1997),” NCCUSL Archives, <a class="link" target="_blank" href="http://www.law.upenn.edu/bll/archives/ulc/fnact99/1990s/upa97fa.pdf">http://www.law.upenn.edu/bll/archives/ulc/fnact99/1990s/upa97fa.pdf</a>.</span></p>

            <h2 class="title editable block">Meaning of “Legal Entity”</h2>
            <p class="para editable block" id="mayer_1.0-ch40_s01_s03_s01_p01">A significant difference between a partnership and most other kinds of business organization relates to whether, and the extent to which, the business is a legal entity. A legal entity is a person or group that the law recognizes as having legal rights, such as the right to own and dispose of property, to sue and be sued, and to enter into contracts; the <span class="margin_term"><a class="glossterm">entity theory</a><span class="glossdef">The concept of a business firm as a legal person, with existence and accountability separate from its owners.</span></span> is the concept of a business firm as a legal person, with existence and accountability separate from its owners. When individuals carry out a common enterprise as partners, a threshold legal question is whether the partnership is a legal entity. The common law said no. In other words, under the common-law theory, a partnership was but a convenient name for an aggregate of individuals, and the rights and duties recognized and imposed by law are those of the individual partners. By contrast, the mercantile theory of the law merchant held that a partnership is a legal entity that can have rights and duties independent of those of its members.</p>
            <p class="para editable block" id="mayer_1.0-ch40_s01_s03_s01_p02">During the drafting of the 1914 UPA, a debate raged over which theory to adopt. The drafters resolved the debate through a compromise. In Section 6(1), UPA provides a neutral definition of partnership (“an association of two or more persons to carry on as co-owners a business for profit”) and retained the common-law theory that a partnership is an aggregation of individuals—the <span class="margin_term"><a class="glossterm">aggregate theory</a><span class="glossdef">The theory that a business firm is not an entity but rather a collection of individual owners who bind themselves together to share profits.</span></span>.</p>
            <p class="para editable block" id="mayer_1.0-ch40_s01_s03_s01_p03">RUPA moved more toward making partnerships entities. According to the NCCUL, “The Revised Act enhances the entity treatment of partnerships to achieve simplicity for state law purposes, particularly in matters concerning title to partnership property. RUPA does not, however, relentlessly apply the entity approach. The aggregate approach is retained for some purposes, such as partners’ joint and several liability.”<span class="footnote" id="mayer_1.0-fn40_004">University of Pennsylvania Law School, Biddle Law Library, “Uniform Partnership Act (1997),” NCCUSL Archives, <a class="link" target="_blank" href="http://www.law.upenn.edu/bll/archives/ulc/fnact99/1990s/upa97fa.pdf">http://www.law.upenn.edu/bll/archives/ulc/fnact99/1990s/upa97fa.pdf</a>.</span> Section 201(a) provides, “A partnership is an entity distinct from its partners.”<span class="footnote" id="mayer_1.0-fn40_005">RUPA, Section 201(a).</span></p>

            <p class="para editable block" id="mayer_1.0-ch40_s01_s03_s02_p01">Under RUPA, then, a partnership has entity characteristics, but the partners remain guarantors of partnership obligations, as always—that is the partners’ joint and several liability noted in the previous paragraph (and discussed further in <a class="xref" href="mayer_1.0-ch41#mayer_1.0-ch41">Chapter 23 "Partnership Operation and Termination"</a>). This is a very important point and a primary weakness of the partnership form: all partners are, and each one of them is, ultimately personally liable for the obligations of the partnership, without limit, which includes personal and unlimited liability. This personal liability is very distasteful, and it has been abolished, subject to some exceptions, with limited partnerships and limited liability companies, as discussed in <a class="xref" href="mayer_1.0-ch42#mayer_1.0-ch42">Chapter 24 "Hybrid Business Forms"</a>. And, of course, the owners of corporations are also not generally liable for the corporation’s obligations, which is a major reason for the corporate form’s popularity.</p>

                <p class="para editable block" id="mayer_1.0-ch40_s01_s03_s02_s03_p01">In litigation, the aggregate theory causes some inconvenience in naming and serving partnership defendants: under UPA, lawsuits to enforce a partnership contract or some other right must be filed in the name of all the partners. Similarly, to sue a partnership, the plaintiff must name and sue each of the partners. This cumbersome procedure was modified in many states, which enacted special statutes expressly permitting suits by and against partnerships in the firm name. In suits on a claim in federal court, a partnership may sue and be sued in its common name. The move by RUPA to make partnerships entities changed very little. Certainly it provides that “a partnership may sue and be sued in the name of the partnership”—that’s handy where the plaintiff hopes for a judgment against the partnership, without recourse to the individual partners’ personal assets.<span class="footnote" id="mayer_1.0-fn40_006">RUPA, Section 307(a).</span> But a plaintiff must still name the partnership and the partners individually to have access to both estates, the partnership and the individuals’: “A judgment against a partnership is not by itself a judgment against a partner. A judgment against a partnership may not be satisfied from a partner’s assets unless there is also a judgment against the partner.”<span class="footnote" id="mayer_1.0-fn40_007">RUPA, Section 307(c).</span></p>

                <p class="para editable block" id="mayer_1.0-ch40_s01_s03_s02_s04_p01">Aggregate theory concepts bedeviled property co-ownership issues, so UPA finessed the issue by stating that partnership property, real or personal, could be held in the name of the partners as “tenants in partnership”—a type of co-ownership—or it could be held in the name of the partnership.<span class="footnote" id="mayer_1.0-fn40_008">Uniform Partnership Act, Section 25(1); UPA, Section 8(3).</span> Under RUPA, “property acquired by the partnership is property of the partnership and not of the partners.”<span class="footnote" id="mayer_1.0-fn40_009">RUPA, Section 203.</span> But RUPA is no different from UPA in practical effect. The latter provides that “property originally brought into the partnership stock or subsequently acquired by purchase…on account of the partnership, is partnership property.”<span class="footnote" id="mayer_1.0-fn40_010">UPA, Section 8(1).</span> Under either law, a partner may bring onto the partnership premises her own property, not acquired in the name of the partnership or with its credit, and it remains her separate property. Under neither law can a partner unilaterally dispose of partnership property, however labeled, for the obvious reason that one cannot dispose of another’s property or property rights without permission.<span class="footnote" id="mayer_1.0-fn40_011">UPA, Sections 9(3)(a) and 25; RUPA, Section 302.</span> And keep in mind that partnership law is the default: partners are free to make up partnership agreements as they like, subject to some limitations. They are free to set up property ownership rules as they like.</p>

The partnership cannot discharge its debts in a liquidation proceeding under Chapter 7 of the bankruptcy law, but it can be rehabilitated under Chapter 11 (see <a class="xref" href="mayer_1.0-ch30#mayer_1.0-ch30">Chapter 35 "Bankruptcy"</a>).</p>

                    <p class="para" id="mayer_1.0-ch40_s01_s03_s02_s05_p02">Partnership law is very important because it is the way most small businesses are organized and because it is possible for a person to become a partner without intending to. Partnership law goes back a long way, but in the United States, most states—but not all—have adopted the Revised Uniform Partnership Act (RUPA, 1997) over the previous Uniform Partnership Act, originally promulgated in 1914. One salient change made by RUPA is to directly announce that a partnership is an entity: it is like a person for purposes of accounting, litigation, bankruptcy, and owning real estate. Partnerships do not pay taxes; the individual partners do. But in practical terms, what RUPA does is codify already-existing state law on these matters, and partners are free to organize their relationship as they like in the partnership agreement.</p>
