        <p class="para editable block" id="mayer_1.0-ch42_s01_s01_p01">The limited partnership is attractive because of its treatment of taxation and its imposition of limited liability on its limited partners.</p>
        <div class="section" id="mayer_1.0-ch42_s01_s01_s01">
            <h2 class="title editable block">Governing Law</h2>
            <p class="para editable block" id="mayer_1.0-ch42_s01_s01_s01_p01">The original source of limited partnership law is the Uniform Limited Partnership Act (ULPA), which was drafted in 1916. A revised version, the Revised Uniform Limited Partnership Act (RULPA), was adopted by the National Conference of Commissioners on Uniform Laws in 1976 and further amended in 1985 and in 2001.</p>
            <p class="para editable block" id="mayer_1.0-ch42_s01_s01_s01_p02">The 2001 act was</p>

                <p class="para editable" id="mayer_1.0-ch42_s01_s01_s01_p03">drafted for a world in which limited liability partnerships and limited liability companies can meet many of the needs formerly met by limited partnerships. This Act therefore targets two types of enterprises that seem largely beyond the scope of LLPs and LLCs: (i) sophisticated, manager-entrenched commercial deals whose participants commit for the long term, and (ii) estate planning arrangements (family limited partnerships). The Act accordingly assumes that, more often than not, people utilizing it will want (1) strong centralized management, strongly entrenched, and (2) passive investors with little control over or right to exit the entity. The Act’s rules, and particularly its default rules, have been designed to reflect these assumptions.<span class="footnote" id="mayer_1.0-fn42_001">“Uniform Limited Partnership Act (2001), Prefatory Note,” NCCUSL Archives, <a class="link" target="_blank" href="http://www.law.upenn.edu/bll/archives/ulc/ulpa/final2001.pdf">http://www.law.upenn.edu/bll/archives/ulc/ulpa/final2001.pdf</a>.</span></p>

            <p class="para editable block" id="mayer_1.0-ch42_s01_s01_s01_p04">All states except Louisiana adopted the 1976 or 1985 act—most opting for the 1985 version—and sixteen states have adopted the 2001 version. The acts may be properly referred to with a hyphen: “ULPA-1985,” or “ULPA-2001”; the word <em class="emphasis">revised</em> has been dropped. Here, we mainly discuss ULPA-1985. The Uniform Partnership Act (UPA) or the Revised Uniform Partnership Act (RUPA) also applies to limited partnerships except where it is inconsistent with the limited partnership statutes. The ULPA-2001 is not so much related to UPA or RUPA as previous versions were.</p>

        <p class="para editable block" id="mayer_1.0-ch42_s01_s02_p01">Unlike a general partnership, a limited partnership is created in accordance with the state statute authorizing it. There are two categories of partners: limited and general. The limited partners capitalize the business and the general partners run it.</p>
        <div class="section" id="mayer_1.0-ch42_s01_s02_s01">
            <h2 class="title editable block">Creation</h2>
            <p class="para editable block" id="mayer_1.0-ch42_s01_s02_s01_p01">The act requires that the firm’s promoters file a <span class="margin_term"><a class="glossterm">certificate of limited partnership</a><span class="glossdef">The document filed with the appropriate state authority that, when approved, marks the legal existence of the limited partnership.</span></span> with the secretary of state; if they do not, or if the certificate is substantially defective, a general partnership is created. The certificate must be signed by all general partners. It must include the name of the limited partnership (which must include the words <em class="emphasis">limited partnership</em> so the world knows there are owners of the firm who are not liable beyond their contribution) and the names and business addresses of the general partners. If there are any changes in the general partners, the certificate must be amended. The general partner may be, and often is, a corporation. Having a general partner be a corporation achieves the goal of limited liability for everyone, but it is somewhat of a “clunky” arrangement. That problem is obviated in the limited liability company, discussed in <a class="xref" href="mayer_1.0-ch42_s02#mayer_1.0-ch42_s02">Section 24.2 "Limited Liability Companies"</a>. Here is an example of a limited partnership operating agreement: <a class="link" target="_blank" href="http://www.wyopa.com/Articles%20of%20limited%20partnership.htm">http://www.wyopa.com/Articles%20of%20limited%20partnership.htm</a>.</p>

The contributions may be money, services, or property, or promises to make such contributions in the future.</p>

An assignment is usually made as security for a loan. The assignee becomes a new limited partner only if all the others consent or if provided for in the certificate; the assignment does not cause dissolution.

            <p class="para editable block" id="mayer_1.0-ch42_s01_s06_s01_p01">Dissolution of a limited partnership is the first step toward termination (but termination does not necessarily follow dissolution). The limited partners have no power to dissolve the firm except on court order, and the death or bankruptcy of a limited partner does not dissolve the firm. The following events may cause dissolution: (1) termination of the partnership as per the certificate’s provisions; (2) termination upon an event specified in the partnership agreement; (3) the unanimous written consent of the partners; (4) the withdrawal of a general partner, unless at least one remains and the agreement says one is enough, or if within ninety days all partners agree to continue; (5) an event that causes the business to be illegal; and (6) judicial decree of dissolution when it is not reasonable to carry on. If the agreement has no term, its dissolution is not triggered by some agreed-to event, and none of the other things listed cause dissolution.</p>
            <p class="para editable block" id="mayer_1.0-ch42_s01_s06_s01_p02">Dissolution requires the filing of a certificate of cancellation with the state if winding up commences.</p>

Any partner or that person’s legal representative can petition a court for winding up, with cause.</p>
            <p class="para editable block" id="mayer_1.0-ch42_s01_s06_s02_p02">Upon winding up, the assets are distributed (1) to creditors, including creditor-partners, not including liabilities for distributions of profit; (2) to partners and ex-partners to pay off unpaid distributions; (3) to partners as return of capital contributions, unless otherwise agreed; and (4) to partners for partnership interests in proportion as they share in distributions, unless otherwise agreed. No distinction is made between general and limited partners—they share equally, unless otherwise agreed. When winding up is completed, the firm is terminated.</p>
            <p class="para editable block" id="mayer_1.0-ch42_s01_s06_s02_p03">It is worth reiterating the part about “unless otherwise agreed”: people who form any kind of a business organization—partnership, a hybrid form, or corporations—can to a large extent choose to structure their relationship as they see fit. Any aspect of the company’s formation, operation, or ending that is not included in an agreement flops into the default provisions of the relevant law.</p>

                <p class="para" id="mayer_1.0-ch42_s01_s06_s02_p04">A limited partnership is a creature of statute: it requires filing a certificate with the state because it confers on some of its members the marvel of limited liability. It is an investment device composed of one or more general partners and one or more limited partners; limited partners may leave with six months’ notice and are entitled to an appropriate payout. The general partner is liable as a partner is a general partnership; the limited partners’ liability is limited to the loss of their investment, unless they exercise so much control of the firm as to become general partners. The general partner is paid, and the general and limited partners split profit as per the agreement or, if none, in the proportion as they made capital contributions. The firm is usually taxed like a general partnership: it is a conduit for the partners’ income. The firm is dissolved upon the end of its term, upon an event specified in the agreement, or in several other circumstances, but it may have indefinite existence.</p>
