        <h2 class="title editable block">The Paperwork Burden</h2>
        <p class="para editable block" id="mayer_1.0-ch05_s04_s01_p01">The administrative process is not frictionless. The interplay between government agency and private enterprise can burden business operations in a number of ways. Several of these are noted in this section.</p>
        <p class="para editable block" id="mayer_1.0-ch05_s04_s01_p02">Deciding whether and how to act are not decisions that government agencies reach out of the blue. They rely heavily on information garnered from business itself. Dozens of federal agencies require corporations to keep hundreds of types of records and to file numerous periodic reports. The Commission on Federal Paperwork, established during the Ford administration to consider ways of reducing the paperwork burden, estimated in its final report in 1977 that the total annual cost of federal paperwork amounted to $50 billion and that the 10,000 largest business enterprises spent $10 billion annually on paperwork alone. The paperwork involved in licensing a single nuclear power plant, the commission said, costs upward of $15 million.</p>
        <p class="para editable block" id="mayer_1.0-ch05_s04_s01_p03">Not surprisingly, therefore, businesses have sought ways of avoiding requests for data. Since the 1940s, the Federal Trade Commission (FTC) has collected economic data on corporate performance from individual companies for statistical purposes. As long as each company engages in a single line of business, data are comparable. When the era of conglomerates began in the 1970s, with widely divergent types of businesses brought together under the roof of a single corporate parent, the data became useless for purposes of examining the competitive behavior of different industries. So the FTC ordered dozens of large companies to break out their economic information according to each line of business that they carried on. The companies resisted, but the US Court of Appeals for the District of Columbia Circuit, where much of the litigation over federal administrative action is decided, directed the companies to comply with the commission’s order, holding that the Federal Trade Commission Act clearly permits the agency to collect information for investigatory purposes.<span class="footnote" id="mayer_1.0-fn05_002"><em class="emphasis">In re FTC Line of Business Report Litigation</em>, 595 F.2d 685 (D.C. Cir. 1978).</span></p>
        <p class="para editable block" id="mayer_1.0-ch05_s04_s01_p04">In 1980, responding to cries that businesses, individuals, and state and local governments were being swamped by federal demands for paperwork, Congress enacted the Paperwork Reduction Act. It gives power to the federal Office of Management and Budget (OMB) to develop uniform policies for coordinating the gathering, storage, and transmission of all the millions of reports flowing in each year to the scores of federal departments and agencies requesting information. These reports include tax and Medicare forms, financial loan and job applications, questionnaires of all sorts, compliance reports, and tax and business records. The OMB was given the power also to determine whether new kinds of information are needed. In effect, any agency that wants to collect new information from outside must obtain the OMB’s approval.</p>

    <div class="section" id="mayer_1.0-ch05_s04_s02">
        <h2 class="title editable block">Inspections</h2>
        <p class="para editable block" id="mayer_1.0-ch05_s04_s02_p01">No one likes surprise inspections. A section of the Occupational Safety and Health Act of 1970 empowers agents of the Occupational Safety and Health Administration (OSHA) to search work areas for safety hazards and for violations of OSHA regulations. The act does not specify whether inspectors are required to obtain search warrants, required under the Fourth Amendment in criminal cases. For many years, the government insisted that surprise inspections are not unreasonable and that the time required to obtain a warrant would defeat the surprise element. The Supreme Court finally ruled squarely on the issue in 1978. In <em class="emphasis">Marshall v. Barlow’s, Inc.</em>, the court held that no less than private individuals, businesses are entitled to refuse police demands to search the premises unless a court has issued a search warrant.<span class="footnote" id="mayer_1.0-fn05_003"><em class="emphasis">Marshall v. Barlow’s, Inc.</em>, 436 US 307 (1978).</span></p>
        <p class="para editable block" id="mayer_1.0-ch05_s04_s02_p02">But where a certain type of business is closely regulated, surprise inspections are the norm, and no warrant is required. For example, businesses with liquor licenses that might sell to minors are subject to both overt and covert inspections (e.g., an undercover officer may “search” a liquor store by sending an underage patron to the store). Or a junkyard that specializes in automobiles and automobile parts may also be subject to surprise inspections, on the rationale that junkyards are highly likely to be active in the resale of stolen autos or stolen auto parts.<span class="footnote" id="mayer_1.0-fn05_004"><em class="emphasis">New York v. Burger</em>, 482 US 691 (1987).</span></p>
        <p class="para editable block" id="mayer_1.0-ch05_s04_s02_p03">It is also possible for inspections to take place without a search warrant and without the permission of the business. For example, the Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) wished to inspect parts of the Dow Chemical facility in Midland, Michigan, without the benefit of warrant. When they were refused, agents of the EPA obtained a fairly advanced aerial mapping camera and rented an airplane to fly over the Dow facility. Dow went to court for a restraining order against the EPA and a request to have the EPA turn over all photographs taken. But the Supreme Court ruled that the areas photographed were “open fields” and not subject to the protections of the Fourth Amendment.<span class="footnote" id="mayer_1.0-fn05_005"><em class="emphasis">Dow Chemical Co. v. United States Environmental Protection Agency</em>, 476 US 227 (1986).</span></p>

        <h2 class="title editable block">Access to Business Information in Government Files</h2>
        <p class="para editable block" id="mayer_1.0-ch05_s04_s03_p01">In 1966, Congress enacted the Freedom of Information Act (FOIA), opening up to the citizenry many of the files of the government. (The act was amended in 1974 and again in 1976 to overcome a tendency of many agencies to stall or refuse access to their files.) Under the FOIA, any person has a legally enforceable right of access to all government documents, with nine specific exceptions, such as classified military intelligence, medical files, and trade secrets and commercial or financial information if “obtained from a person and privileged or confidential.” Without the trade-secret and financial-information exemptions, business competitors could, merely by requesting it, obtain highly sensitive competitive information sitting in government files.</p>
        <p class="para editable block" id="mayer_1.0-ch05_s04_s03_p02">A federal agency is required under the FOIA to respond to a document request within ten days. But in practice, months or even years may pass before the government actually responds to an FOIA request. Requesters must also pay the cost of locating and copying the records. Moreover, not all documents are available for public inspection. Along with the trade-secret and financial-information exemptions, the FOIA specifically exempts the following:</p>
        <ul class="itemizedlist editable block" id="mayer_1.0-ch05_s04_s03_l01">
            <li>records required by executive order of the president to be kept secret in the interest of national defense or public policy</li>
            <li>records related solely to the internal personnel rules and practice of an agency</li>
            <li>records exempted from disclosure by another statute</li>
            <li>interagency memos or decisions reflecting the deliberative process</li>
            <li>personnel files and other files that if disclosed, would constitute an unwarranted invasion of personal privacy</li>
            <li>information compiled for law enforcement purposes</li>
            <li>geological information concerning wells</li>
        </ul>
        <p class="para editable block" id="mayer_1.0-ch05_s04_s03_p03">Note that the government may provide such information but is not required to provide such information; it retains discretion to provide information or not.</p>
        <p class="para editable block" id="mayer_1.0-ch05_s04_s03_p04">Regulated companies are often required to submit confidential information to the government. For these companies, submitting such information presents a danger under the FOIA of disclosure to competitors. To protect information from disclosure, the company is well advised to mark each document as privileged and confidential so that government officials reviewing it for a FOIA request will not automatically disclose it. Most agencies notify a company whose data they are about to disclose. But these practices are not legally required under the FOIA.</p>

            <h3 class="title">Key Takeaway</h3>
            <p class="para" id="mayer_1.0-ch05_s04_s03_p05">Government agencies, in order to do their jobs, collect a great deal of information from businesses. This can range from routine paperwork (often burdensome) to inspections, those with warrants and those without. Surprise inspections are allowed for closely regulated industries but are subject to Fourth Amendment requirements in general. Some information collected by agencies can be accessed using the Freedom of Information Act.</p>
