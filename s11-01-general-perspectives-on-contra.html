        <h2 class="title editable block">The Role of Contracts in Modern Society</h2>
        <p class="para editable block" id="mayer_1.0-ch08_s01_s01_p01">Contract is probably the most familiar legal concept in our society because it is so central to the essence of our political, economic, and social life. In common parlance, contract is used interchangeably with <em class="emphasis">agreement</em>, <em class="emphasis">bargain</em>, <em class="emphasis">undertaking</em>, or <em class="emphasis">deal</em>. Whatever the word, the concept it embodies is our notion of freedom to pursue our own lives together with others. Contract is central because it is the means by which a free society orders what would otherwise be a jostling, frenetic anarchy.</p>
        <p class="para editable block" id="mayer_1.0-ch08_s01_s01_p02">So commonplace is the concept of contract—and our freedom to make contracts with each other—that it is difficult to imagine a time when contracts were rare, when people’s everyday associations with one another were not freely determined. Yet in historical terms, it was not so long ago that contracts were rare, entered into if at all by very few: that affairs should be ordered based on mutual assent was mostly unknown. In primitive societies and in feudal Europe, relationships among people were largely fixed; traditions spelled out duties that each person owed to family, tribe, or manor. People were born into an ascribed position—a status (not unlike the caste system still existing in India)—and social mobility was limited. Sir Henry Maine, a nineteenth-century British historian, wrote that “the movement of the progressive societies has…been a movement from status to contract.”<span class="footnote" id="mayer_1.0-fn08_001">Sir Henry Maine, <em class="emphasis">Ancient Law</em> (1869), 180–82.</span> This movement was not accidental—it developed with the emerging industrial order. From the fifteenth to the nineteenth century, England evolved into a booming mercantile economy, with flourishing trade, growing cities, an expanding monetary system, the commercialization of agriculture, and mushrooming manufacturing. With this evolution, contract law was created of necessity.</p>
        <p class="para editable block" id="mayer_1.0-ch08_s01_s01_p03">Contract law did not develop according to a conscious plan, however. It was a response to changing conditions, and the judges who created it frequently resisted, preferring the imagined quieter pastoral life of their forefathers. Not until the nineteenth century, in both the United States and England, did a full-fledged law of contracts arise together with, and help create, modern capitalism.</p>
        <p class="para editable block" id="mayer_1.0-ch08_s01_s01_p04">Modern capitalism, indeed, would not be possible without contract law. So it is that in planned economies, like those of the former Soviet Union and precapitalistic China, the contract did not determine the nature of an economic transaction. That transaction was first set forth by the state’s planning authorities; only thereafter were the predetermined provisions set down in a written contract. Modern capitalism has demanded new contract regimes in Russia and China; the latter adopted its Revised Contract Law in 1999.</p>
        <p class="para editable block" id="mayer_1.0-ch08_s01_s01_p05">Contract law may be viewed economically as well as culturally. In <em class="emphasis">An Economic Analysis of Law</em>, Judge Richard A. Posner (a former University of Chicago law professor) suggests that contract law performs three significant economic functions. First, it helps maintain incentives for individuals to exchange goods and services efficiently. Second, it reduces the costs of economic transactions because its very existence means that the parties need not go to the trouble of negotiating a variety of rules and terms already spelled out. Third, the law of contracts alerts the parties to troubles that have arisen in the past, thus making it easier to plan the transactions more intelligently and avoid potential pitfalls.<span class="footnote" id="mayer_1.0-fn08_002">Richard A. Posner, <em class="emphasis">Economic Analysis of Law</em> (New York: Aspen, 1973).</span></p>

        <h2 class="title editable block">The Definition of <em class="emphasis">Contract</em>
</h2>
        <p class="para editable block" id="mayer_1.0-ch08_s01_s02_p01">As usual in the law, the legal definition of <span class="margin_term"><a class="glossterm">contract</a><span class="glossdef">A legally enforceable set of promises.</span></span> is formalistic. The Restatement (Second) of Contracts (Section 1) says, “A contract is a promise or a set of promises for the breach of which the law gives a remedy, or the performance of which the law in some way recognizes as a duty.” Similarly, the Uniform Commercial Code says, “‘Contract’ means the total legal obligation which results from the parties’ agreement as affected by this Act and any other applicable rules of law.”<span class="footnote" id="mayer_1.0-fn08_003">Uniform Commercial Code, Section 1-201(11).</span> As operational definitions, these two are circular; in effect, a contract is defined as an agreement that the law will hold the parties to.</p>
        <p class="para editable block" id="mayer_1.0-ch08_s01_s02_p02">Most simply, a contract is a legally enforceable promise. This implies that not every promise or agreement creates a binding contract; if every promise did, the simple definition set out in the preceding sentence would read, “A contract is a promise.” But—again—a contract is not simply a promise: it is a legally enforceable promise. The law takes into account the way in which contracts are made, by whom they are made, and for what purposes they are made. For example, in many states, a wager is unenforceable, even though both parties “shake” on the bet. We will explore these issues in the chapters to come.</p>

        <h2 class="title editable block">Overview of the Contracts Chapter</h2>
        <p class="para editable block" id="mayer_1.0-ch08_s01_s03_p01">Although contract law has many wrinkles and nuances, it consists of four principal inquiries, each of which will be taken up in subsequent chapters:</p>
        <ol class="orderedlist editable block" id="mayer_1.0-ch08_s01_s03_l01">
            <li>
                <p class="para">Did the parties create a valid contract? Four elements are necessary for a valid contract:</p>
                <ol class="orderedlist" id="mayer_1.0-ch08_s01_s03_l02" numeration="loweralpha">
                    <li>Mutual assent (i.e., offer and acceptance), <a class="xref" href="mayer_1.0-ch09#mayer_1.0-ch09">Chapter 9 "The Agreement"</a>
</li>
                    <li>Real assent (no duress, undue influence, misrepresentation, mistake, or incapacity), <a class="xref" href="mayer_1.0-ch10#mayer_1.0-ch10">Chapter 10 "Real Assent"</a>
</li>
                    <li>Consideration, <a class="xref" href="mayer_1.0-ch11#mayer_1.0-ch11">Chapter 11 "Consideration"</a>
</li>
                    <li>Legality, <a class="xref" href="mayer_1.0-ch12#mayer_1.0-ch12">Chapter 12 "Legality"</a>
</li>
                </ol>
            </li>
            <li>What does the contract mean, and is it in the proper form to carry out this meaning? Sometimes contracts need to be in writing (or evidenced by some writing), or they can’t be enforced. Sometimes it isn’t clear what the contract means, and a court has to figure that out. These problems are taken up in <a class="xref" href="mayer_1.0-ch13#mayer_1.0-ch13">Chapter 13 "Form and Meaning"</a>.</li>
            <li>Do persons other than the contracting parties have rights or duties under the contract? Can the right to receive a benefit from the contract be assigned, and can the duties be delegated so that a new person is responsible? Can persons not a party to the contract sue to enforce its terms? These questions are addressed in <a class="xref" href="mayer_1.0-ch14#mayer_1.0-ch14">Chapter 14 "Third-Party Rights"</a>.</li>
            <li>How do contractual duties terminate, and what remedies are available if a party has breached the contract? These issues are taken up in <a class="xref" href="mayer_1.0-ch15#mayer_1.0-ch15">Chapter 15 "Discharge of Obligations"</a> and <a class="xref" href="mayer_1.0-ch16#mayer_1.0-ch16">Chapter 16 "Remedies"</a>.</li>
        </ol>
        <p class="para editable block" id="mayer_1.0-ch08_s01_s03_p02">Together, the answers to these four basic inquiries determine the rights and obligations of contracting parties.</p>

            <h3 class="title">Key Takeaway</h3>
            <p class="para" id="mayer_1.0-ch08_s01_s03_p03">Contract law developed when the strictures of feudalism dissipated, when a person’s position in society came to be determined by personal choice (by mutual agreement) and not by status (by how a person was born). Capitalism and contract law have developed together, because having choices in society means that people decide and agree to do things with and to each other, and those agreements bind the parties; the agreements must be enforceable.</p>
